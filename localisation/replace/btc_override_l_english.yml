Taking inspiration from the strong plating on the sides and a covered roof to protect the crew from missile fire, they are calling it the turtle ship. The fearsome appearance of this new warship and the strength of its defenses will ensure that the naval superiority Korea requires to be defensible is never lost!"
 desc_kor_turtle_fleets:0 "The turtle ship was a type of large warship used by the Korean navy during the Japanese Invasions of Korea (1592–1598), during which it played a key role in preventing the Japanese from attaining naval superiority, ultimately forcing them to retreat. Their name derives from the ship's protections, with a covered roof shaped vaguely like the shell of a turtle.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that these were the first iron clad warships, but in point of fact it is not known whether versions were ever built with iron plating."

# Venice #
 flavor_ven.15.d:0 "The safety and prosperity of Venice has always relied upon its location in its lagoon. In 1501, in an effort to reduce the silting up of the lagoon, the Maggior Consiglio formed a committee to deflect the rivers flowing into the lagoon, a committee known as the 'Savi alle Acque'. Their success over the years saved the Serenissima from disaster and extended the prosperity of the city.\nWhat shall we do?"
 desc_ven_council_of_ten_strong:0 "While originally intended to only deal with dangers to the republican system the Council of Ten has been given quite far reaching powers to do what the Maggior Consiglio can't. Some feel this has been a step too far, however, and paradoxically the Council of Ten itself might be the greatest threat to the representative system currently."

 desc_ven_nobility_bought:0 "In order to counteract the decreasing numbers of nobles in our republic and the Maggior Consiglio we have begun to give out membership in exchange for a large sum of money."
 flavor_ven.24.d:0 "With over a thousand hereditary memberships, the Maggior Consiglio of Venice is perhaps not always the quickest and most efficient governing body. It is therefore not surprising that the much greater flexibility of the small Council of Ten, originally intended to safeguard the republic from plots and conspiracies, has led to them assuming more and more power.\nBy increasing its own power, however, the Council of Ten decreases the influence of the more representative Maggior Consiglio. Many of the families on the Maggior Consiglio feel things have gone too far as while new members of the Ten are elected each year the positions are often monopolized by a small clique of old Aristocrat families. Reforms have been proposed to curtail the power of the Ten by limiting their influence to emergencies as was originally intended."
 flavor_ven.25.d:0 "The reforms to rein in the Council of Ten has calmed many of the members of the Maggior Consiglio but in effect the Ten still exert a great deal of authority that they formally should not have. Given how inefficient the Maggior Consiglio with its countless members can be at times this is, however, not necessarily a bad thing..."
 flavor_ven.26.t:0 "Expansion of the Maggior Consiglio."
 flavor_ven.26.d:0 "The Maggior Consiglio is the body from which the members of the various councils, the Doge and the Venetian Senate are elected. It is this council with over a thousand members that the Venetian system is built upon and by allowing all of these nobles their say our Republic is more representative than any other state we know of. A powerful council is the best safeguard against any other government institutions becoming too powerful, including the office of the Doge itself.\nSome feel we should expand the council even further to encompass all nobles over a certain age while others feel that many voices in one place might stifle the day-to-day government."
 flavor_ven.26.a:0 "Enlarge the Maggior Consiglio."
 flavor_ven.27.d:0 "As positions on the Maggior Consiglio are hereditary there is always the possibility of a noble family retaining their vote after having lost their fortunes and all other influence. As we cannot expect such noble families to labor for their living the Venetian state traditionally affords them small pensions to live on.\nWith the chaotic political situation in the east, the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the loss of Venetian influence in parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, this group of poor nobles have been growing quickly. The great number of impoverished nobles are known to spend their pensions on gambling in or near the Campo San Barnaba and some will even sell their votes to anyone willing to pay. Sometimes referred to as Barnabotti, after the Campo in which they reside, this group is still not a great problem. If this development continues, however, it might well undermine the Maggior Consiglio and unduly increase the power of those with the money to pay for votes."
 flavor_ven.30.d:0 "Our city has always been at danger of great epidemics and as another plague outbreak washes over northern Italy, Venice has been hit unusually hard. Almost one third of our population has been lost. The disease strikes at poor and rich alike and we have lost many men of quality. The number of nobles on the Maggior Consiglio has also decreased sharply shaking the political foundation of our Republic."
 flavor_ven.31.d:0 "Ever since the Great Plague of the 1630s we have had problems filling the positions of the Venetian government. Conferring nobility on new people must be done with care, however, as any new member of the Maggior Consiglio will have a vote a dramatic amount of newcomers might lead to entirely unpredictable results. It has been suggested that the best way to vet candidates for membership is to try their willingness to contribute to the state. A number of richer families might be ennobled if they contribute a good sum to the treasury. Those without wealth are simply not the kind of people we would want to decide the fate of our Republic."
