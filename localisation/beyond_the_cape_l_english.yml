 BEYOND_THE_CAPE_DESC:0 "With the Reconquista almost complete, and the Iberian peninsula almost entirely in Christian hands, the kingdom of Portugal has turned its attention to the shores of Africa. With the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 the founder of the Avis dynasty, João I, has already made the first inroads into the Moorish homeland. A policy that his grandson, the still young Afonso V will continue to the best of his abilities. It is however through the work of Afonso's uncle, Dom Henrique, Henry the Navigator, that Portugal will leave its mark upon the world..."

# Lisbon Earthquake #

 btc_por.1_t:0 "The Great Earthquake of $YEAR$"
 btc_por.1_d:0 "On this day, a devastating earthquake struck the city of Lisbon, capital of Portugal. The quake was felt as far away as Morocco and caused widespread damage, destroying many buildings and claiming countless lives. Survivors describe the ground heaving up and down like waves, and buildings collapsing like sandcastles. The death toll is estimated to be in the thousands, and the city is left in a state of chaos and despair. The aftershocks continue to rattle the city, and the people of Lisbon must come together to rebuild their homes and their lives in the wake of this terrible tragedy."
 btc_por.1A:0 "Immediately evacuate Lisbon"
 btc_por.1B:0 "Lead the people to the open spaces of the central plaza"
 btc_por.1C:0 "The safety of the royal family is of the utmost priority"
 btc_por.2_t:0 "The Wrath of the Ocean"
 btc_por.2_d:0 "In the aftermath of the earthquake, massive waves surged up the Tagus River, engulfing much of the city's harbor and waterfront areas. The destruction caused was catastrophic, sweeping away buildings, ships, and people alike. The waves reached heights of over 6 meters in some areas, smashing through the lower floors of buildings and sweeping residents out to sea. The loss of life was staggering, and the impact on the city's infrastructure was immense."
 btc_por.2A:0 "Why did God allow this to happen?"
 btc_por.3_t:0 "The Ensuing Fires"
 btc_por.3_d:0 "A series of fires have spread throughout the city, engulfing buildings and leaving many without homes or shelter. As we survey the damage and those affect, we must decide how to respond to this tragedy."

 btc_por.4_t:0 "Marquês de Pombal"
 btc_por.4_d:0 "Literally from the ashes of Lisboa, a new leader rose to the power and managed to shake entire Portugal out of the trauma caused by the earthquake. He forced through many far reaching reforms. During his rule Lisboa was rebuilt and Portugal entered into the pre-industrial era. In many ways his excellent governing would, for a time, bring back Portugal almost to its former level of glory a few hundred years back."
 btc_por.4A:0 "An excellent minister"
 btc_por.5_t:0 "The Aftermath"
 btc_por.5_d:0 "As the dust settles and the city begins to assess the damage, it becomes clear that the destruction is widespread and severe. Homes and buildings lie in ruins, the streets are littered with debris, and many are injured, homeless, or without basic necessities. Trade routes have been disrupted, infratructure made useless, and economic instability threats to worsen with each passing day."
 btc_por.5A:0 "We cannot afford to look weak to our enemies"

 btc_por.5C:0 "Levy a special tax for the reconstruction efforts"

Reports have surfaced of widespread looting throughout the city, as individuals took advantage of the destruction to steal goods and valuables. Valuable resources were seized and hoarded by those who had them, leaving many without the basic necessities for survival."
 btc_por.6A:0 "There is barely anything to loot anyway"
 btc_por.6B:0 "Make a show of force"
 btc_por.6C:0 "The situation changes nothing on proper procedure"
 btc_por.7_t:0 "Recovery Efforts"
 btc_por.7_d:0 "Your advisors report that recovery efforts are underway, with teams of workers and volunteers working tirelessly to clear the rubble and provide aid to those in need.

 btc_por.7E:0 "The Marquês has the situation under control"
 btc_por.8_t:0 "The Reconstruction of Lisbon"
 btc_por.8_d:0 "Manuel da Maia, a prominent engineer and architect, outlines four potential courses of action for the future of the city. The first option is to completely abandon Lisbon and rebuild a new city elsewhere. The second option is to not make any major changes to Lisbon and instead focus on repairing and rebuilding the existing infrastructure and buildings. The third option is to rebuild Lisbon in the same location, but with significant improvements to building codes, making the city more resilient to future disasters. The fourth option would rebuild the city with changes to the layout and design to improve its functionality and aesthetics. This would require a significant investment in urban planning and architecture."

 btc_por.91A:0 "Belém is the new capital"
 btc_por.92_t:0 "Lisbon Rebuilt"
 btc_por.92_d:0 "We have managed to rebuild the city as it was before the earthquake struck, preserving its history and cultural heritage, as well as a desire to maintain continuity and stability for the portuguese people."
 btc_por.92A:0 "Lisbon is rebuilt to its former glory"
 btc_por.93_t:0 "A Modern City"
 btc_por.93_d:0 "The rebuilding of Lisbon with wider streets was a massive undertaking, requiring significant resources and expertise.
