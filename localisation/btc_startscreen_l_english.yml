 btc_startscreen.2_t:0 "Portugal tutorial"
 btc_startscreen.2_d:0 "Portugal has new ideas, missions, provinces, terrain and trade goods. There is also a new trade node called Lisboa. Portugal has the ability to add a Feitoria modifier to any African or Asian coastal province they own - except on the Maghreb and Egypt regions. There is a new holy order unique to Portugal - the Order of Christ.\n\nThere are two unique decisions for Portugal related to the special units Caravel and Galleon. One decision changes Caravels into Square-Rigged Caravels - a more expensive, combat-oriented caravel - and the other decision changes Galleons into Naus, giving the ability to transport units, sacrificing combat power. Portugal no longer starts with a historical friendship with Castile, so be on your toes!"\n\nThe Portuguese Monarchy government also has a new mechanic called Saudade. It starts at zero and goes up to 100. It is increased or decreased based on the idea groups you pick (check their bonuses), the decision Portuguese Focus, and the difference between state provinces (SP) and territory provinces (TP).\n\nHere are the 6 different levels of Saudade defined by your provinces. The number shown in parenthesis is the difference between SP and TP, such that the number 10 means there are 10 more TP than SP, and -5 means that there are 5 more SP than TP:\n\n - Almost No Saudade (-15)\n - Very Little Saudade (-10)\n - Little Saudade (-5)\n - Some Saudade (5)\n - A Lot Of Saudade (10)\n - Too Much Saudade (15)"

 btc_startscreen.3_t:0 "Exploration"
 btc_startscreen.3_d:0 "The exploration system has been changed a bit from how it works in vanilla. For starters, exploration ideas no longer have the Quest for the New World idea, so you will not be able to explore just by picking that idea group. However, you will require that idea group if you want to explore.\n\nWhen you reach diplomatic tech 7 while having exploration ideas, an event will fire giving you the ability to hire explorers, conquistadors and sailing the open seas. Portugal and Castile have an advantage here. Portugal already starts with an explorer, and through their mission tree they will be able to acquire new ones. They will, however, be unable to discover the new world and can only sail around Africa.\n\nThey will have the chance to get the Christopher Columbus event if the year is 1480 and Portugal has not discovered the Cape of Good Hope. Castile will get the event if Granada does not own any province in Iberia. However, if one country gets the event then the other country won't. This means that either Portugal or Castile will be able to discover the new world before any other country if the conditions are met.\n\nThe Caribbean region is no longer a colonial region, so the Treaty of Tordesillas will no longer have any effect on countries wanting to colonize there."

 btc_startscreen.4_d:0 "This disaster is much more immersive now. As Castile, Aragon and Portugal you can actually have a major impact in the future of the region. No longer do you have only 2 options to give improved relations and some rebels to fight. Learn more about each country below."

 btc_startscreen.41_d:0 "The triggers for the disaster to fire are exactly the same as before, but the consequences are much more dire. You get -5% discipline for the duration of the disaster, as well as -65% land forcelimit and global manpower. When it fires you are given two options - to support the Portuguese candidate Joanna, or the Aragonese candidate Isabella. Your choice will become the new Queen of Castile, and you may even get an alliance with the country she came from.\n\nHowever, the country you did not choose may contest your decision and declare war for the throne. Due to the morale malus you've incurred, it is paramount that you fight this war with diplomacy. It is also possible that neither country will want to support their claimant, in which case all you'll have to do is defeat the pretender rebels for the disaster to end.\n\nIf you do have to fight a war, regardless of whether you win or lose, the disaster will end when the war ends and you will share an heir with the country you are allied to. This heir may be the one to unite the two countries in a personal union."

 btc_startscreen.42_d:0 "When Castile gets the civil war disaster, they will have to choose between Portugal and Aragon. If they choose Portugal, we can press the claim or ignore it. Regardless, Joanna will become Queen of Castile and Aragon will get an event to contest that claim, and they may declare war on Castile, and we will be called to war if we pressed our claim.\n\nFrance will also get an event in which they can choose to support us, but they won't be called to war. When the war ends, if we win then our monarch will be Castile's consort and Joanna will become our consort and Castile's ruler. We both get an heir named Isabel. This heir may be the one to unite the two countries in a personal union."

 btc_startscreen.5_t:0 "Sound Tolls"
 btc_startscreen.5_d:0 "The Oresund and Bosphorus tolls no longer exist in the game as a static modifier in their respective provinces. Now countries will actually have to control the straits in order to receive the sound toll bonuses. There are a total of 6 tolls to unlock:\n\nGibraltar Toll: own Gibraltar and Ceuta.\nOresund Toll: own Ostjylland, Kolding, Fyn, Lolland, Sjaelland and Skane.\nBosphorus Toll: own Constantinople, Gelibolu, Biga, Hüdavendigar and Kocaeli.\nArab Toll: own Tajura and Mukha.\nPersian Toll: own Qawasim, Hormuz and Mogostan.\nSingapore Toll: own Siak, Johor and Singapura.\n\nOnce you hold all provinces required for the toll to unlock, each of those provinces will get +5 trade power. If you lose any of those provinces, all of them will lose the modifier."

 btc_startscreen.6_t:0 "Castile tutorial"
 btc_startscreen.6_d:0 "Castile has a couple new additions in this mod. Other than the Castilian Civil War overhaul (which is covered in another tutorial section), there are also other interesting events. Let's take a look at them now.\n\nSoon after the game starts, Castile will receive an event regarding the nobility power in Galicia. This will give the provinces in Galicia region increased autonomy. There are two ways to get rid of this modifier.\n\nThe first is through an event that may happen - the Irmandiños Revolts. This will give Castile two choices on how to handle the situation, one of them will remove the modifier.\nThe other way is for the Castilian Civil War disaster to fire, which will remove the modifier from the galician provinces.\n\nAnother string of events is related to Granada. Castile starts with a truce with Granada. Once the truce ends, Granada will get an event with two choices - to either pay the Castilians for protection, which is the paria tax, or not to pay this tax.\n\nIf Granada pays the paria, another 5 years truce will be created between the countries. This event will fire every time both countries do not have a truce. If Granada decides not to pay the paria, Castile will get an event in which they can choose to declare war on Granada, or simply ignore the whole thing, creating a new truce. However, after this truce is over, Granada will no longer get the event to pay the paria.\n\nGranada can keep choosing to pay the paria until 1480. After this, they will have no choice but to refuse payment."
