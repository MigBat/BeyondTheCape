 btc_startscreen.21_d: "Portugal has unique governments that change as you progress down the mission tree. You will be able to see specifics of each of them below, but first let's focus on what they all have in common.\n\nPortuguese governments gives Portugal the ability to add a Feitoria to any African or Asian coastal province they own - except on the Maghreb and Egypt regions. This will give the province increased trade power. They can be upgraded to a Fortified Feitoria via mission, which will increase the province's defensiveness. You can also establish Feitorias in foreign territory, provided you have good relations with the owner of the province. These are known as Foreign Feitorias, and will give you 5 trade power in the node the province belongs to. They are limited to 5 per country.\n\nPortugal also has access to the Cortes. They are the portuguese parliament, and there are numerous unique issues to Portugal. Some of them are required to complete certain missions, others will improve your Fidalgos - or revoke their privileges - so be on the lookout. You'll be able to unlock these unique cortes issues as soon as your initial regency ends."

 btc_startscreen.211_d: "This is the government reform you start with. The Portuguese Monarchy government unlocks a mechanic called Naval Professionalism. It starts at zero and goes up to 100. It fills up faster the more naval tradition you have, so make sure you have plenty of light ships protecting trade or privateering for a steady increase.\n\nHigh Naval Professionalism increases your ship trade power, disengagement chance and number of cannons on ships. Aside from that, there are three interactions available to you once you have at least 50 Naval Professionalism:\n- Attract Renowned Shipwrights will decrease shipbuilding time and cost.\n- Expand Port Capacity increases your naval forcelimit.\n- Spread Navy Propaganda gives you more sailors and marines.\n\nEach of these interactions provide a modifier that lasts for 10 years."

 btc_startscreen.212_t: "Portuguese Empire"
 btc_startscreen.212_d: "You unlock this government reform shortly after reaching India. The Portuguese Empire government unlocks a mechanic called Saudade. It starts at zero and goes up to 100. It is increased or decreased based on the idea groups you pick (check their bonuses), the decision Portuguese Focus, and the difference between state provinces (SP) and territory provinces (TP).\n\nHere are the 7 different levels of Saudade defined by your provinces. The number shown in parenthesis is the difference between SP and TP, such that the number 10 means there are 10 more TP than SP, and -5 means that there are 5 more SP than TP:\n\n - Almost No Saudade (-15)\n - Very Little Saudade (-10)\n - Little Saudade (-5)\n - No Saudade (0)\n - Some Saudade (5)\n - A Lot Of Saudade (10)\n - Too Much Saudade (15)\n\nAdditionally, the larger the cities you have, the less Saudade they give. This is to represent how a large developed city is attractive to people rather than pushing them to leave the country. Once a city hits 30 development you get the first level of Saudade reduction. From then on, each 5 development will increase the level like so:\n\n - Small Capital (30 dev)\n - Medium Capital (35 dev)\n - Big Capital (40 dev)\n - Grand Capital (45 dev)\n - Colossal Capital (50 dev)\n - Metropolis (55 dev)"

 btc_startscreen.213_d: "Very late in the game there is a mission that will unlock either the Absolutist Monarchy or Liberal Monarchy, depending on the outcome of the Liberal Wars disaster (more on that on the Disasters section).\n\nThese do not have special mechanics like the previous reforms. Here is what sets them apart:\n\nThe Absolutist Monarchy focuses on centralized control. It increases your Absolutism and gives you greater power over the Cortes. The influence of estates is greatly reduced, as power is concentrated on the King.\n\nThe Liberal Monarchy has very reduced maximum Absolutism, but much higher army and navy morale and reduced unrest and separatism."

 btc_startscreen.22_t: "Disasters"
 btc_startscreen.22_d: "Portugal has three unique disasters in this mod, each happening at different stages of the game, providing a challenge throughout your run. Read all about them below."

 btc_startscreen.22d: "Liberal Wars"
 btc_startscreen.22a: "Go back"

 btc_startscreen.221_t: "Bragança Plot"
 btc_startscreen.221_d: "This disaster happens immediately upon the start of the next month and will last until your regency ends. The Duke of Bragança is a powerful noble who seeks to increase his standing in the realm. This fragile regency is a perfect opportunity for him to influence the regent Infante Pedro and the young king Afonso.\n\nThroughout Afonso's regency, you will be presented with numerous events that will give you two options. One will please the Duke, the other will not. Each option has their rewards and drawbacks, so you need to think in both short and long term. In each event, you will see the current state of mind of the Duke - whether is he pleased or displeased - and with that information you can choose the best option.\n\nOnce the regency ends, depending on the options you made, there will be one of two outcomes.\n- If the Duke is pleased, you will gain stability and cheap advisors. However, it is possible that you have given far too much influence to the Nobility in the options chosen, so prepare for the consequences.\n- If the Duke is displeased, he will convince the king that Infante Pedro is a rebel. You will lose your starting general, as well as Henrique as an advisor. A rebel stack will appear in Coimbra and you will get increased country-wide autonomy that will last until the end of Afonso's reign. He will also be more military-focused.\n\nYou can also try to assassinate the Duke. If you manage, you'll get the same effects as pleasing him, without the influence penalty. But should you fail, the autonomy increase will be even more severe."

 btc_startscreen.222_t: "Overextended Empire"
 btc_startscreen.222_d: "This disaster is triggered from the Saudade mechanic (read the Portuguese Government tutorial section before you read this).\n\nWhen you have at least 3 times as many territories as there are state provinces in your country, or your commercial enterprise subject Casa da India has more than your total development, this disaster will start ticking. It will tick faster the higher your saudade is.\n\n When it happens, you get a variety of maluses to your overall production capabilities, reinforcement abilities, colonisation efforts and treasure fleet size. The aim of this disaster is to represent the difficulties associated with managing a large overseas empire as a small nation.\n\nWhile the disaster is active, you will get -1 monthly Saudade, and when 2 years have passed since it started this disaster will end. Bear in mind that this is a repeatable disaster, so if the trigger conditions are met again it will happen once more."
 btc_startscreen.222a: "Go back"

 btc_startscreen.223_t: "Liberal Wars"
 btc_startscreen.223_d: "This disaster aims to represent the portuguese liberal wars of the 1820s. Although historically they happened after the end date, it is plausible that they could have happened before and I also think it is fun to be represented as a late game challenge and content.\n\nThis disaster is triggered when you are in the Age of Revolutions, while having a colony in Brazil. It can only happen if a revolution target exists, or if the revolution has been destroyed for good. Progress will increase based on your Absolutism and global unrest.\n\nWhen the disaster is triggered, pretender rebels will spawn in every portuguese culture province that is not an island. Additionally, Brazil will declare war on Portugal after a few months, so you will have to deal with these two issues. The goal of this disaster is to shape how the country will move forward from here.\n\nThere are two unique peace options which you can choose. If you decide to make Miguel the ruler of Portugal, the country will remain absolutist. If you do not choose this option, the country will go liberal. The other unique option is to make Brazil a colony again. Depending on your combination of choices of these two options, there are a total of 4 different outcomes to this disaster.\n\nWhen it is over, you will be able to complete the Rise of Liberalism mission in order to unlock either a unique absolutist government reform or a unique liberal government reform (more on that in the Governments section)."

 btc_startscreen.23_t: "Historical Run"
 btc_startscreen.23_d: "While designing this mod, I wanted to properly represent Portugal's achievement of reaching India by 1498. Although this is possible in vanilla EU4, it does not represent how they did it historically. It was not satisfactory enough for me, so a big part of design was making sure that all pieces align perfectly to reach this goal as historically accurate as the game allows.\n\nYou can try and figure out for yourself how this is done by playing the mod normally, or you can keep on reading to know exactly what you need to do. This tutorial will show you how to get to India as Portugal by colonizing only historical provinces."

 btc_startscreen.231_t: "First Things First"
 btc_startscreen.231_d: "Before you unpause, start off by hiring Henrique o Navegador as your diplomatic advisor, then grant the Burghers Naval School Rights privilege to the Burghers. This will allow you to complete the mission Sagres School of Navigation.\n\nAs you can see, this has unlocked new missions for you to complete. These are innovations researched at Sagres School. For the purposes of this tutorial, we need to complete the Ocean Currents mission, which will give you +25% colonial range.\n\nNext up, you need to unlock at least 3 ideas from the Exploration idea group, as the 1st idea will give you +50% colonial range and the 3rd will unlock your 1st national idea which gives +25% colonial range.\n\nAnother very important thing to do is to choose the 1st option of The Silk Road Crisis event. This event will happen after you have Exploration ideas, and the 1st option will give you +25% colonial range. Also make sure to always have a navigator as your advisor, as they give +20% colonial range. As long as you own the Algarve province with the Sagres School modifier, you can always hire a navigator.\n\nWith all this, you will have +120% colonial range, and that is all you will need. Keep following the middle branch of the mission tree. We will talk about the Cape of Torments mission next."
 btc_startscreen.231a: "Cape of Torments"
 btc_startscreen.231b: "Go back"

 btc_startscreen.232_t: "Cape of Torments"
 btc_startscreen.232_d: "If you followed all the steps in the previous section, you will have successfully colonized Arguin and Cape Coast, both via mission. Also, you will have +120% colonial range (It is possible to get a bit more, but it is not required for the purposes of this tutorial). You will have noticed that, despite all this, you are unable to reach the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Torments. You could always slowly colonize south in order to get some range to reach the cape, but it's not going to make getting to India any faster. So instead concentrate your colonial efforts in Cape Verde and the São Tomé islands in order to complete your missions.\n\nYou are unable to reach Cape of Torments because you do not have diplomatic tech 8, which gives +60 colonial range. You need to research it. Once you do, and you complete the mission, you'll notice that you have unlocked a unique flagship modification called Portuguese Navigators. This gives your flagship increased exploration range (not colonial range). Now is the time to build your flagship with this modification, place it in a fleet with 2 other ships and explore the Cape Route region which is now available to you.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully reached India by sea, replicating the original journey made by Vasco da Gama. Now the Portuguese Empire will start to bloom."

 btc_startscreen.24_t: "Afonso de Albuquerque"
 btc_startscreen.24_d: "Afonso de Albuquerque was one of the mightiest conquerors in history. Due to his actions, Portugal established a monopoly in the Indian ocean that would last for a hundred years and effectively placed them amongst the richest and strongest countries in the world. He was known for his ferocity, bravery and especially for his unrivalled hatred for Islam. For these reasons, and more, he holds a special place in the mod's design. Let's see what he offers.\n\nOnce you complete the Casa da India mission, Afonso de Albuquerque will become available to you as a General. For as long as he remains so, there are a number of unique abilities he offers:\n\n- When he is leading an army that sieges down the provinces of Zanzibar, Aden, Hormuz, Goa or Malacca, those provinces will immediately be ceded to Portugal without requiring a peace deal. This aims to represent his conquests of these key provinces that allowed for Portugal to get a monopoly on the Indian Ocean.\n\n- Access to a casus belli named Afonso de Albuquerque Crusade. His hatred for Islam was such that he had formulated plans to cripple the Islamic world as much as possible. Two of those plans are represented in the mod.\nOne of them was diverting the course of the Nile river to bring devastation to Egypt.\nThe other was taking the body of the Prophet Muhammad and use it as a bargaining chip to demand the muslims leave the Holy Land.\n\n- For an alternate history playthrough, you will be able to form the Albuquerque Company, which will be a Conqueror Party subject of Portugal. This new subject behaves much like a tributary. However, when its leader dies the company dissolves, loses all land, and you continue playing as the overlord. Conqueror Parties have objectives to complete while the ruler is alive, so take a look at the Decisions tab and choose which one to pursue.\n\nFinally, if you dismiss Albuquerque as a leader, he will be made the Governor of Casa da India (if you have it). If he dies the same will happen, but I have made an abstraction so as not to lose immersion. You'll see it when you get there.\n\nAnd these are the things you can do with Albuquerque. Now go out there and fulfil his ambitions!"

 btc_startscreen.3_t: "The Spice Trade"
 btc_startscreen.3_d: "The Spice Trade was a major historical network of commerce that facilitated the exchange of valuable spices such as pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg between Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and other regions. Originating in ancient times, it reached its peak during the Age of Exploration, when European powers like Portugal and Spain sought direct sea routes to Asia to bypass middlemen. Spices were highly prized for their use in cuisine, medicine, and preservation, driving global exploration and competition for control of trade routes.\n\nTo best simulate this in the game, two mechanics have been developed - Gold Spices and the Spice Trade Conflict."

 btc_startscreen.31_t: "Gold Spices"
 btc_startscreen.31_d: "When Portugal reached India, they began sending yearly armadas—fleets of large carracks—to transport valuable spices back to Europe, generating enormous profits. Now, you can replicate this historic trade using the treasure fleet mechanic.\n\nCountries with a Commercial Enterprise subject that owns at least one province producing spices will have access to this mechanic. A random spice-producing province within your Commercial Enterprise will convert its production to what is referred to as "Gold Spice." This term is used because this trade good behaves similarly to Gold, albeit less valuable, and incorporates the production from all spice-producing provinces within the Commercial Enterprise.\n\nThe production of the Gold Spice province will be stored and sent to the overlord as part of a treasure fleet each year. The more spice-producing provinces your Commercial Enterprise has, the greater the bonus to treasure fleet income. However, each spice-producing province will experience reduced production to represent a portion of the output being sent to the overlord.\n\nTo ensure the consistency of yearly treasure fleets, certain adjustments have been made. The Gold Spice province cannot exceed a base production of 5."
 btc_startscreen.31a: "Go back"

 btc_startscreen.32_t: "Spice Trade Conflict"
 btc_startscreen.32_d: "The Spice Trade Conflict began when Portugal reached the Indian Ocean and disrupted existing trade routes by redirecting commerce around Africa into Europe. Traditional trading powers, such as the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and Venice, suffered economically from this shift and sought to halt Portuguese dominance in the region.\n\nThis conflict begins sometime after Portugal establishes a province in India. It sets the strongest trade power in the Alexandria trade node—usually the Mamluks—against Portugal. Both sides can recruit supporters to their cause, with each ally contributing trade power from their provinces to influence control over the Indian Ocean trade nodes.\n\nEach side has specific objectives to achieve victory in the conflict:\n- The Portuguese side must dominate trade in all five trade nodes in the Indian Ocean to fill the Mare Clausum bar.\n- The Mamluk side must either complete four designated objectives or prevent Portugal from achieving its goal within 50 years of the conflict's start.\n\nControl over specific trade nodes grants unique bonuses to each side. As Mare Clausum accumulates, unique events and modifiers will affect the nations involved, further shaping the conflict's progression.\n\nMore details about the Spice Trade Conflict can be found on the conflict screen, accessible on the left side of the mini-map once the event becomes active."

Now the candidate you do not choose for the throne will take control of either Wales or Northumberland and fight you for the throne of England. You will be able to play as any of these three countries, and the winner will unite England.\n\nAll Irish nations now start as tributaries to England. During the Age of Reformation, if the state religion of the overlord is different than that of the subject, there is a chance the tributary will declare their independence.\n\nFollowing in the steps of Columbus, John Cabot will approach England to finance a journey to the New World, potentially discovering new lands ripe for the taking."

 btc_startscreen.343_d: "The Shogun can no longer integrate daimyos and requires favors and a high opinion to call them to war. Daimyos also have increased liberty desire and increased aggressive expansion from taking land from other daimyos. All this makes Japan harder to be formed. Later in the game, when the Portuguese and Dutch have discovered Japan, one daimyo with high opinion of either of these countries will get an event giving them the opportunity to embrace colonialism, which is otherwise normally unobtainable unless you have engaged in colonisation. This daimyo will have the technological edge over the remaining ones, and potentially be able to unite Japan."

However, you will require that idea group if you want to explore.\n\nWhen you reach diplomatic tech 9 while having completed exploration ideas, an event will fire giving you the ability to hire explorers, conquistadors and sailing the open seas. Portugal already starts with an explorer, and through their mission tree they will be able to acquire new ones. They will, however, be unable to discover the new world and can only sail around Africa.\n\nColonial nations can no longer colonize outside their own colonial region, and your non-colonial nation subjects will be unable to colonize in a colonial region where you have a colonial nation. Additionally, if for whatever reason you have two colonial nations in the same colonial region, you have an interaction that allows you to combine them. It is also worth mentioning that the Caribbean is no longer a colonial region, instead being a trade company region."

 btc_startscreen.41_t: "The Settler Pool"
 btc_startscreen.41_d: "The settler pool is a new mechanic introduced in this mod that aims to represent the availability of settlers for colonisation. Bigger countries with a higher population inherently have a higher settler pool than smaller countries. What this mechanic aims to achieve is the accurate representation of colonial empires.\n\nTake Portugal and Castile as the two preeminent examples. Castile is much larger than Portugal, and after forming Spain almost doubles in size and development. This is represented historically in how their colonial empires existed. Castile and Spain held vast amount of lands in the New World, while Portugal controlled a string of trade posts along the african coast and indian ocean, as well as the brazilian coast. Portugal simply did not have the resources Spain had to properly and successfully maintain a large colonial empire.\n\nYou unlock the Settler Pool when you have at least 1 colonist, and on the top left corner of the screen you will see the Settler Pool icon. Click it and a small window will open with a progress bar that ranges from 0 to 5000 settlers. The more settlers you have, the bigger the bonuses to colonization. Here's an overview of the bonuses:\n- Over 3000 settlers you get a bonus to colonial growth.\n- Under 4000 settlers you get a penalty to colony cost.\n- Under 1000 settlers you get a penalty to settler placement chance. Additionally, you cannot start any new colonies.\n\nThe more development a country has, the faster settlers are replenished. Each active colony costs 50 settlers per month, and 1000 settlers are deducted from the pool the moment a new colony is established."

You can end up finding nothing, or perhaps you'll find some small reward... or maybe you will discover a long lost monument deep in the jungles!\n\nIf you do discover a monument, its location will be revealed to you and you will get a permanent claim in that province.

 btc_startscreen.62_t: "Buildings and Development"
 btc_startscreen.62_d: "The bonuses of buildings have been slightly tweaked, but the major difference now is that each building increases build cost. What this means is that the more buildings you have in one province, the more expensive it is to build new ones. In turn, those buildings also give reduced development cost for the province.\n\nThe more development a province has, the more expensive buildings get (2% per development). Additionally, to balance the development cost reduction given by buildings, the more development a province has, the more expensive it will be to further develop it."

 btc_startscreen.63_t: "War, Devastation and Attrition"
 btc_startscreen.63_d: "When an army occupies an enemy province, there is a chance that the province will lose 1 development in a random category and the occupier will get 5% yearly income, so now more than ever it is important to protect your provinces. This represents violent occupations that reduce the local population.\n\nBe careful with devastation, as now there is a chance that a province with over 10 devastation will lose 1 development as well. This represents the decline of population in devastated provinces.\n\nConversely, when you have a prosperous province it may now receive 1 development in a random category.\n\nMaximum possible attrition has been drastically increased, as have the effects of its sources - such as winter and monsoons. Plan your war campaigns carefully.\n\nTerrains now have an effect on combat width. Grasslands are unchanged, but mountains have a whopping -50% combat width. Discover all other terrain modifiers so you can prepare your defenses and repel larger invading armies with smart army positioning.\n\nCertain sea tiles have also received a modifier that changes local naval engagement width by -50%. This happens in many straits, such as Strait of Gibraltar, Sea of Marmara and Oresund. Large navies won't matter much in naval battles in these tiles."

 btc_startscreen.64_t: "Military Access and Casus Belli"
 btc_startscreen.64_d: "No longer can a country ask any other country in the world for military access. No longer will you see the Ottomans walk through half of Europe to lay siege to Paris. Now you can only ask a neighbour for military access. This will make it so that navies are much more important and you will more often see amphibious assaults. Obviously, this will make your choice of allies much more crucial.\n\nPlease bear in mind that these limitations do not apply to countries in the Holy Roman Empire or countries that are your allies.\n\nMany unique casus belli have been added, such as the Castilian Civil War casus belli and the Grand Crusade casus belli. Most of these are triggered only, meaning that you can only access them under certain conditions. However, there is a new casus belli that you can access any time, provided you finish one of the following idea groups:\n- Exploration ideas.\n- Maritime ideas.\n- Naval ideas.\n\nThis is the Naval War casus belli. You can use it when you have a claim on any country's coastal province and you can only conquer coastal provinces with a claim. The uniqueness of this casus belli is that the warscore is based on naval superiority and blockading ports, giving even more importance to the navy of maritime nations."

 btc_startscreen.65_t: "Institutions, Technology, Ages and Hegemons"
 btc_startscreen.65_d: "Institutions have been completely revamped. No longer do we have arbitrary static dates for the start of an institution. Now they have very clear objectives in order to spawn. While this rework is not eurocentric, the chances of it spawning in Europe are higher than in other continents. Furthermore, institutions such as Colonialism and Industrialization have such requirements that make it almost impossible for the AI to embrace, resulting in a more interesting world where some countries are more technologically advanced than others.\n\nAs a result, technologies have also been changed. Now you will see certain technologies need a certain institution, or else the cost to research it is higher. For example, since the Renaissance institution is already present at game start, countries that do not have it will have a harder time researching tech 4.\n\nSince ages were also tied to institutions, the requirements for the start of a new age have also been changed. This rework made it so that each age lasts roughly the same amount of time.\n\nTo give more flavour to each age and a renewed importance to the Hegemon mechanic, each age now has Potential Hegemons. For more information about them, click below."

 btc_startscreen.66_t: "Professionalism and Unique Units"
 btc_startscreen.66_d: "In the 15th century, standing armies started being formed, but this was still a new concept which took time for countries to adopt. Thus, in order to represent this, the Professionalism mechanic has been slightly altered.\n\nLower Professionalism will give bonuses to mercenaries and penalties to regiments, and as it goes up these bonuses and penalties will diminish. Professionalism gain from drilling has also been halved. This encourages early-game usage of mercenaries. However, if you rely only on mercenaries your army will not evolve. It is costly to maintain an army, but undoubtedly a long-term benefit.\n\nOnce the Absolutism mechanic is unlocked, Professionalism gain can be better controlled, as higher Absolutism results in more Professionalism gain, representing the modernization of armies in the 17th century.\n\nCertain countries and cultures have unique ships they employ instead of the default ones. For example, Portugal has a Caravela Redonda instead of a Caravel, and a Nau instead of a Carrack. Find below a list of everyone who at some point in the game has access to a unique unit.\n\nCountries:\n@POR Portugal, @CAS Castile, @ENG England, @VEN Venice, @KOR Korea\nCultures:\n@FRA French, @NED Dutch, @BYZ Byzantine, @JAP Japanese, @MNG Chinese, @OMA Omani, @YEM Yemeni\nCulture groups:\n@GUJ Dravidian, @VIJ Western Aryan"
