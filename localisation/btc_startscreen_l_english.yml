 btc_startscreen.2_d:0 "As the main focus of this mod, Portugal has been completely overhauled, aiming to portray the country as historically accurate as possible while at the same time making sure that it is not overpowered in comparison to other countries.\n\nChanges to the country include:\n\n- New ideas.\n- New mission tree.\n- Dozens of new events.\n- Two unique decisions related to the special units Armada and Full-Rigged Ship. One decision upgrades Armadas into a more expensive, combat-oriented vessel. The other decision upgrades Full-Rigged Ships, giving them the ability to transport units while sacrificing combat power.\n- Decision to form Iberia. Portugal can no longer form Spain.\n- Portugal and Castile are no longer historical friends.\n- Unique holy order.\n- New provinces.\n- New government mechanics (click below for more info)."

 btc_startscreen.21_t:0 "Portuguese Government"
 btc_startscreen.21_d:0 "The Portuguese Monarchy government gives Portugal the ability to add a Feitoria modifier to any African or Asian coastal province they own - except on the Maghreb and Egypt regions.\n\nThere is also a new mechanic called Saudade. It starts at zero and goes up to 100. It is increased or decreased based on the idea groups you pick (check their bonuses), the decision Portuguese Focus, and the difference between state provinces (SP) and territory provinces (TP).\n\nHere are the 6 different levels of Saudade defined by your provinces. The number shown in parenthesis is the difference between SP and TP, such that the number 10 means there are 10 more TP than SP, and -5 means that there are 5 more SP than TP:\n\n - Almost No Saudade (-15)\n - Very Little Saudade (-10)\n - Little Saudade (-5)\n - Some Saudade (5)\n - A Lot Of Saudade (10)\n - Too Much Saudade (15)\n\nAdditionally, the larger the cities you have, the less Saudade they give. This is to represent how a large developed city is attractive to people rather than pushing them to leave the country. Once a city hits 30 development you get the first level of Saudade reduction. From then on, each 5 development will increase the level like so:\n\n - Small Capital (30 dev)\n - Medium Capital (35 dev)\n - Big Capital (40 dev)\n - Grand Capital (45 dev)\n - Colossal Capital (50 dev)\n - Metropolis (55 dev)"

 btc_startscreen.22_t:0 "Overextended Empire Disaster"
 btc_startscreen.22_d:0 "This disaster is triggered from the Saudade mechanic (read the Portuguese Government tutorial section before you read this).\n\nWhen you have 100 Saudade and at least 5 times as many territories as there are state provinces in your country, this disaster will start ticking. When it happens, you get a variety of maluses to your overall production capabilities, reinforcement abilities and colonisation efforts. The aim of this disaster is to represent the difficulties associated with managing a large overseas empire as a small nation.\n\nWhile the disaster is active, you will get -1 monthly Saudade, and when you have less than 50 Saudade this disaster will end. Bear in mind that this is a repeatable disaster, so if the trigger conditions are met again it will happen once more."

 btc_startscreen.31_d:0 "Castile has a couple new additions in this mod. Other than the Castilian Civil War overhaul (which is covered in another tutorial section), there are also other interesting events. Let's take a look at them now.\n\nSoon after the game starts, Castile will receive an event regarding the nobility power in Galicia. This will give the provinces in Galicia region increased autonomy. There are two ways to get rid of this modifier.\n\nThe first is through an event that may happen - the Irmandiños Revolts. This will give Castile two choices on how to handle the situation, one of them will remove the modifier.\nThe other way is for the Castilian Civil War disaster to fire, which will remove the modifier from the galician provinces.\n\nAnother string of events is related to Granada, which starts as a tributary to Castile. There will come a time when Granada can decide not to pay the paria, at which point Castile will get an event in which they can choose to declare war on Granada.\n\nAragon also got some love, in the form of a new government called Crown of Aragon that focuses on diplomacy. Sardinia and Sicily now start as junior partners of Aragon, and through the Aragonese mission tree, the rewards for integrating Sardinia, Sicily and Naples is an upgrade of the Crown of Aragon government.\n\nAdditionally, valencian and balearic cultures have been added."

 btc_startscreen.32_t:0 "Low Countries Region"
 btc_startscreen.32_d:0 "Burgundy has received new events that focus on the conquest of the Low Countries through vassalization, giving a special casus belli that will ensure that the Emperor will not be called to the war you declare.\n\nThe requirements to form The Netherlands have also been changed, with the country no longer requiring 10 provinces to form it. The Dutch Revolt has also been changed slightly, with more rebels spawning. This should ensure that the Netherlands is formed by the AI, either through a Dutch country or through the Dutch Revolution.\n\nThe Netherlands was a very important country during this timeframe and it should appear much more often in the game. Their missions have also been worked on to reflect the rivalry with Portugal, and the possibility to form the VOC. They also have new events and a unique colonisation strategy in Colonial Eastern America using the Patroonschap system. You can find our more about this in their namesake mission."

 btc_startscreen.33_d:0 "The War of the Roses disaster for England has been reworked. Now the candidate you do not choose for the throne will take control of either Wales or Northumberland and fight you for the throne of England. You will be able to play as any of these three countries, and the winner will unite England.\n\nAll Irish nations now start as tributaries to England. During the Age of Reformation, if the state religion of the overlord is different than that of the subject, there is a chance the tributary will declare their independence.\n\nFollowing in the steps of Columbus, John Cabot will approach England to finance a journey to the New World, potentially discovering new lands ripe for the taking."
 btc_startscreen.33a:0 "Go back"

 btc_startscreen.4_t:0 "Exploration"
 btc_startscreen.4_d:0 "The exploration system has been changed a lot from how it works in vanilla. For starters, exploration ideas no longer have the Quest for the New World idea, so you will not be able to explore just by picking that idea group. However, you will require that idea group if you want to explore.\n\nWhen you reach diplomatic tech 9 while having exploration ideas, an event will fire giving you the ability to hire explorers, conquistadors and sailing the open seas. Portugal and Castile have an advantage here. Portugal already starts with an explorer, and through their mission tree they will be able to acquire new ones. They will, however, be unable to discover the new world and can only sail around Africa.\n\nThey will have the chance to get the Christopher Columbus event if Portugal has exploration ideas and the year is 1488. If Portugal has already discovered the Cape of Good Hope by the time this event fires, the only option will be to reject his offer. Castile will get the event if it has exploration ideas, all provinces in Upper and Lower Andalucia are owned by catholic countries, and Portugal rejected Columbus. This means that either Portugal or Castile will be able to discover the New World before any other country if the conditions are met.\n\nIn case Castile hires Columbus, they will discover a route to the caribbeans, which is no longer a colonial region. Portugal can claim these discoveries and Castile can negotiate with Portugal, resulting in the Treaty of Tordesillas, which will only allow Castile to colonise the New World, and Portugal to colonise the Old World.\n\nThe three native policies have also been changed completely, providing 3 different colonisation strategies.\n\nThe expansion, exploration, maritime and naval idea groups have received slight modifications.\n\nColonial nations can no longer colonize outside their own colonial region, and your non-colonial nation subjects will be unable to colonize in a colonial region where you have a colonial nation. Additionally, if for whatever reason you have two colonial nations in the same colonial region, you have an interaction that allows you to combine them."

 btc_startscreen.41_t:0 "The Settler Pool"
 btc_startscreen.41_d:0 "The settler pool is a new mechanic introduced in this mod that aims to represent the availability of settlers for colonisation. Bigger countries with a higher population inherently have a higher settler pool than smaller countries. What this mechanic aims to achieve is the accurate representation of colonial empires.\n\nTake Portugal and Castile as the two preeminent examples. Castile is much larger than Portugal, and after forming Spain almost doubles in size and development. This is represented historically in how their colonial empires existed. Castile and Spain held vast amount of lands in the New World, while Portugal controlled a string of trade posts along the african coast and indian ocean, as well as the brazilian coast. Portugal simply did not have the resources Spain had to properly and successfully maintain a large colonial empire.\n\nFor more information about how this mechanic works and what you can do to increase your settler pool, head over to the Decisions tab once you have 1 colonist. The Settler Pool decision will be available for you there."

 btc_startscreen.42_t:0 "The Seven Cities of Gold"
 btc_startscreen.42_d:0 "There are 8 legends to discover in the New World. El Dorado, Cibola, Fountain of Youth... Once your conquistador starts exploring he will get an event to search for these cities, and you will get options along the way. The decisions you take during the search will impact your chances of success. You can end up finding nothing, or perhaps you'll find some small reward... or maybe you will discover a long lost monument deep in the jungles!\n\nIf you do discover a monument, its location will be revealed to you and you will get a permanent claim in that province. When you colonize that province, you can discover the monument. No nation other than the one that completed the initial conquistador quest can find this monument."

 btc_startscreen.51_d:0 "The triggers for the disaster to fire are exactly the same as before, but the consequences are much more dire. You get -5% discipline for the duration of the disaster, as well as -65% land forcelimit and global manpower. When it fires you are given two options - to support the Portuguese candidate Joanna, or the Aragonese candidate Isabella. Your choice will become the new Queen of Castile, and you may even get an alliance with the country she came from.\n\nHowever, the country you did not choose may contest your decision and declare war for the throne. Due to the morale malus you've incurred, it is paramount that you fight this war with diplomacy. It is also possible that neither country will want to support their claimant, in which case all you'll have to do is defeat the pretender rebels for the disaster to end.\n\nIf you do have to fight a war, regardless of whether you win or lose, the disaster will end when the war ends and you will share an heir with the country you are allied to. This heir may be the one to unite the two countries in a personal union."

Regardless, Joanna will become Queen of Castile and Aragon will get an event to contest that claim, and they may declare war on Castile, and we will be called to war if we pressed our claim.\n\nFrance will also get an event in which they can choose to support us, but they won't be called to war. When the war ends, if we win then our monarch will be Castile's consort and Joanna will become our consort and Castile's ruler. We both get an heir named Isabel.

 btc_startscreen.61_t:0 "Sound Tolls and Slavers Estate"
 btc_startscreen.61_d:0 "The Oresund and Bosphorus sound tolls no longer exist in the game as a static modifier in their respective provinces. Now countries will actually have to control the straits in order to receive the sound toll bonuses. There are a total of 6 sound tolls to unlock:\n\nGibraltar Sound: own Gibraltar and Ceuta.\nDenmark Sound: own Ostjylland, Kolding, Fyn, Lolland, Sjaelland and Skane.\nTurkish Sound: own Constantinople, Gelibolu, Biga, Hüdavendigar and Kocaeli.\nYemeni Sound: own Tajura and Mukha.\nHormuz Sound: own Qawasim, Hormuz and Mogostan.\nSingapore Sound: own Siak, Johor and Singapura.\n\nOnce you hold all provinces required for the sound toll to unlock, each of those provinces will get +5 trade power. If you lose any of those provinces, all of them will lose the modifier.\n\nThe aim of the Slavers estate is to simulate the Atlantic Slave Trade. To get this estate, a nation has to fulfill the following conditions:\n\n- The capital of the country is in Europe.\n- Owns a province producing slaves, or owns a province in the Guinea region or Congo region, or has 10% trade power in Ivory Coast node.\n- The country or a subject of the country owns at least 5 provinces in the New World that produce cocoa, coffee, cotton, sugar, tea or tobacco.\n- The country must have at least 1 coastal province.\n- The Abolish Slavery Act decision must not have been enacted."

 btc_startscreen.62_t:0 "Buildings, Development and Corruption"
 btc_startscreen.62_d:0 "The bonuses of buildings have been slightly tweaked, but the major difference now is that each building increases build cost. What this means is that the more buildings you have in one province, the more expensive it is to build new ones. In turn, those buildings also give reduced development cost for the province.\n\nThe more development a province has, the more expensive buildings get (2% per development). Additionally, to balance the development cost reduction given by buildings, the more development a province has, the more expensive it will be to further develop it.\n\nCorruption is now a bigger nuisance than before. Now each advisor you have is a source of corruption, as well as having low crownland, high absolutism and being over governing capacity."

 btc_startscreen.63_t:0 "War, Devastation and Attrition"
 btc_startscreen.63_d:0 "When an army occupies an enemy province, there is a chance that the province will lose 1 development in a random category and the occupier will get 5% yearly income, so now more than ever it is important to protect your provinces. This represents violent occupations that reduce the local population.\n\nBe careful with devastation, as now there is a chance that a province with over 10 devastation will lose 1 development as well. This represents the decline of population in devastated provinces.\n\nConversely, when you have a prosperous province it may now receive 1 development in a random category.\n\nMaximum possible attrition has been drastically increased, as have the effects of its sources - such as winter and monsoons. Plan your war campaigns carefully.\n\nTerrains now have an effect on combat width. Grasslands are unchanged, but mountains have a whopping -50% combat width. Discover all other terrain modifiers so you can prepare your defenses and repel larger invading armies with smart army positioning.\n\nCertain sea tiles have also received a modifier that changes local naval engagement width by -50%. This happens in many straits, such as Strait of Gibraltar, Sea of Marmara and Oresund. Large navies won't matter much in naval battles in these tiles."

 btc_startscreen.64_t:0 "Military Access and Casus Belli"
 btc_startscreen.64_d:0 "No longer can a country ask any other country in the world for military access. No longer will you see the Ottomans walk through half of Europe to lay siege to Paris. Now you can only ask a neighbour for military access. This will make it so that navies are much more important and you will more often see amphibious assaults. Obviously, this will make your choice of allies much more crucial.\n\nPlease bear in mind that these limitations do not apply to countries in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nMany unique casus belli have been added, such as the Castilian Civil War casus belli and the Burgundian Conquests casus belli. Most of these are triggered only, meaning that you can only access them under certain conditions. However, there is a new casus belli that you can access any time, provided you finish one of the following idea groups:\n- Exploration ideas.\n- Maritime ideas.\n- Naval ideas.\n\nThis is the Naval War casus belli. You can use it when you have a claim on any country's coastal province and you can only conquer coastal provinces with a claim. The uniqueness of this casus belli is that the warscore is based on naval superiority and blockading ports, giving even more importance to the navy of maritime nations."

 btc_startscreen.65_t:0 "Institutions, Technology, Ages and Hegemons"
 btc_startscreen.65_d:0 "Institutions have been completely revamped. No longer do we have arbitrary static dates for the start of an institution. Now they have very clear objectives in order to spawn. While this rework is not eurocentric, the chances of it spawning in Europe are higher than in other continents. Furthermore, institutions such as Colonialism and Industrialization have such requirements that make it almost impossible for the AI to embrace, resulting in a more interesting world where some countries are more technologically advanced than others.\n\nAs a result, technologies have also been changed. Now you will see certain technologies need a certain institution, or else the cost to research it is higher. For example, since the Renaissance institution is already present at game start, countries that do not have it will have a harder time researching tech 4.\n\nSince ages were also tied to institutions, the requirements for the start of a new age have also been changed. This rework made it so that each age lasts roughly the same amount of time.\n\nTo give more flavour to each age and a renewed importance to the Hegemon mechanic, each age now has Potential Hegemons.
