 btc_startscreen.21_t:0 "Portuguese Government"
 btc_startscreen.21_d:0 "The Portuguese Monarchy government gives Portugal the ability to add a Feitoria to any African or Asian coastal province they own - except on the Maghreb and Egypt regions. This will give the province increased trade power. They can be upgraded to a Fortified Feitoria via mission, which will increase the province's defensiveness. You can also establish Feitorias in foreign territory, provided you have good relations with the owner of the province. These are known as Foreign Feitorias, and will give you 5 trade power in the node the province belongs to. They are limited to 5 per country.\n\nThere is also a new mechanic called Saudade. It starts at zero and goes up to 100. It is increased or decreased based on the idea groups you pick (check their bonuses), the decision Portuguese Focus, and the difference between state provinces (SP) and territory provinces (TP).\n\nHere are the 6 different levels of Saudade defined by your provinces. The number shown in parenthesis is the difference between SP and TP, such that the number 10 means there are 10 more TP than SP, and -5 means that there are 5 more SP than TP:\n\n - Almost No Saudade (-15)\n - Very Little Saudade (-10)\n - Little Saudade (-5)\n - Some Saudade (5)\n - A Lot Of Saudade (10)\n - Too Much Saudade (15)\n\nAdditionally, the larger the cities you have, the less Saudade they give. This is to represent how a large developed city is attractive to people rather than pushing them to leave the country. Once a city hits 30 development you get the first level of Saudade reduction. From then on, each 5 development will increase the level like so:\n\n - Small Capital (30 dev)\n - Medium Capital (35 dev)\n - Big Capital (40 dev)\n - Grand Capital (45 dev)\n - Colossal Capital (50 dev)\n - Metropolis (55 dev)"

When it happens, you get a variety of maluses to your overall production capabilities, reinforcement abilities and colonisation efforts. The aim of this disaster is to represent the difficulties associated with managing a large overseas empire as a small nation.\n\nWhile the disaster is active, you will get -1 monthly Saudade, and when you have less than 50 Saudade this disaster will end. Bear in mind that this is a repeatable disaster, so if the trigger conditions are met again it will happen once more."

 btc_startscreen.23_d: "While designing this mod, I wanted to properly represent Portugal's achievement of reaching India by 1498. Although this is possible in vanilla EU4, it does not represent how they did it historically. It was not satisfactory enough for me, so a big part of design was making sure that all pieces align perfectly to reach this goal as historically accurate as the game allows.\n\nYou can try and figure out for yourself how this is done by playing the mod normally, or you can keep on reading to know exactly what you need to do. This tutorial will show you how to get to India as Portugal by colonizing only historical provinces."

 btc_startscreen.231_d: "Before you unpause, start off by hiring Henrique o Navegador as your diplomatic advisor, then grant the Burghers Naval School Rights privilege to the Burghers. This will allow you to complete the mission Sagres School of Navigation.\n\nAs you can see, this has unlocked new missions for you to complete. These are innovations researched at Sagres School. For the purposes of this tutorial, we need to complete the Ocean Currents mission, which will give you +25% colonial range. It's not hard to unlock, all you need is some diplomatic power and for at least 50% of your ships to be light ships.\n\nNext up, you need to unlock exploration ideas. Make sure to unlock at least 3 ideas from there, as the 1st idea will give you +50% colonial range and the 3rd will unlock your 1st national idea which gives +25% colonial range.\n\nAnother very important thing to do is to choose the 1st option of The Silk Road Crisis event. This event will happen after you have exploration ideas, and the 1st option will give you +25% colonial range. Also make sure to always have a navigator as your advisor, as they give +20% colonial range. As long as you own the Algarve province with the Sagres School modifier, you can always hire a navigator.\n\nWith all this, you will have +120% colonial range, and that is all you will need. Keep following the middle branch of the mission tree. We will talk about the Cape of Torments mission next."

 btc_startscreen.232_d: "If you followed all the steps in the previous section, you will have successfully colonized Arguin and Cape Coast, both via mission. Also, you will have +120% colonial range (It is possible to get an additional +10%, but it is not required for the purposes of this tutorial). You will have noticed that, despite all this, you are unable to reach the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Torments. You could always slowly colonize south in order to get some range to reach the cape, but it's not going to make getting to India any faster. So instead concentrate your colonial efforts in Cape Verde and the São Tomé islands in order to complete your missions.\n\nYou are unable to reach Cape of Torments because you do not have diplomatic tech 8, which gives +60 colonial range. You need to research it. Once you do, and you complete the mission, you'll notice that you have unlocked a unique flagship modification called Portuguese Navigators. This gives your flagship increased exploration range (not colonial range). Now is the time to build your flagship with this modification, place it in a fleet with 2 other light ships and explore the Cape Route region which is now available to you.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully reached India by sea, replicating the original journey made by Vasco da Gama. Now the Portuguese Empire will start to bloom."

 btc_startscreen.24_t: "Afonso de Albuquerque"
 btc_startscreen.24_d: "Afonso de Albuquerque was one of the mightiest conquerors in history. Due to his actions, Portugal established a monopoly in the Indian ocean that would last for a hundred years and effectively placed them amongst the richest and strongest countries in the world. He was known for his ferocity, bravery and especially for his unrivalled hatred for Islam. For these reasons, and more, he holds a special place in the mod's design. Let's see what he offers.\n\nOnce you complete the Casa da India mission, Afonso de Albuquerque will become available to you as a General. For as long as he remains so, there are a number of unique abilities he offers:\n\n- When he is leading an army that sieges down the provinces of Zanzibar, Aden, Hormuz, Goa or Malacca, those provinces will immediately be ceded to Portugal without requiring a peace deal. This aims to represent his conquests of these key provinces that allowed for Portugal to get a monopoly on the Indian Ocean.\n- Access to a casus belli named Afonso de Albuquerque Crusade. His hatred for Islam was such that he had formulated plans to cripple the Islamic world as much as possible. Two of those plans are represented in the mod.\nOne of them was diverting the course of the Nile river to bring devastation to Egypt.\nThe other was taking the body of the Prophet Muhammad and use it as a bargaining chip to demand the muslims leave the Holy Land.\n\nFinally, if you dismiss Albuquerque as a leader, he will be made the Governor of Casa da India (if you have it). If he dies the same will happen, but I have made an abstraction so as not to lose immersion. You'll see it when you get there.\n\nAnd these are the things you can do with Albuquerque. Now go out there and fulfil his plans!"

Other than the Castilian Civil War overhaul (which is covered in another tutorial section), there are also other interesting events. Let's take a look at them now.\n\nSoon after the game starts, Castile will receive an event regarding the nobility power in Galicia. This will give the provinces in Galicia region increased autonomy. There are two ways to get rid of this modifier.\n\nThe first is through an event that may happen - the Irmandiños Revolts. This will give Castile two choices on how to handle the situation, one of them will remove the modifier.\nThe other way is for the Castilian Civil War disaster to fire, which will remove the modifier from the galician provinces.\n\nAnother string of events is related to Granada, which starts paying a tax - the paria - to Castile. This will be paid yearly but Granada can decide not to pay the paria, at which point Castile will get an event in which they can choose to declare war on Granada.\n\nAragon also got some love, in the form of a new government called Crown of Aragon that focuses on diplomacy. Sardinia and Sicily now start as junior partners of Aragon, and through the Aragonese mission tree, the rewards for integrating Sardinia, Sicily and Naples is an upgrade of the Crown of Aragon government.\n\nAdditionally, valencian and balearic cultures have been added."

The Dutch Revolt has also been changed slightly, with more rebels spawning. This should ensure that the Netherlands is formed by the AI, either through a Dutch country or through the Dutch Revolution.\n\nThe Netherlands was a very important country during this timeframe and it should appear much more often in the game. Their missions have also been worked on to reflect the rivalry with Portugal, and the possibility to form the VOC.

Later in the game, when the Portuguese and Dutch have discovered Japan, one daimyo with high opinion of either of these countries will get an event giving them the opportunity to embrace colonialism, which is otherwise normally unobtainable unless you have engaged in colonisation.

However, you will require that idea group if you want to explore.\n\nWhen you reach diplomatic tech 9 while having exploration ideas, an event will fire giving you the ability to hire explorers, conquistadors and sailing the open seas. Portugal already starts with an explorer, and through their mission tree they will be able to acquire new ones. They will, however, be unable to discover the new world and can only sail around Africa.\n\nColonial nations can no longer colonize outside their own colonial region, and your non-colonial nation subjects will be unable to colonize in a colonial region where you have a colonial nation. Additionally, if for whatever reason you have two colonial nations in the same colonial region, you have an interaction that allows you to combine them. It is also worth mentioning that the Caribbean is no longer a colonial region, instead being a trade company region."

 btc_startscreen.41_d:0 "The settler pool is a new mechanic introduced in this mod that aims to represent the availability of settlers for colonisation. Bigger countries with a higher population inherently have a higher settler pool than smaller countries. What this mechanic aims to achieve is the accurate representation of colonial empires.\n\nTake Portugal and Castile as the two preeminent examples. Castile is much larger than Portugal, and after forming Spain almost doubles in size and development. This is represented historically in how their colonial empires existed. Castile and Spain held vast amount of lands in the New World, while Portugal controlled a string of trade posts along the african coast and indian ocean, as well as the brazilian coast. Portugal simply did not have the resources Spain had to properly and successfully maintain a large colonial empire.\n\nFor more information about how this mechanic works and what you can do to increase your settler pool, head over to the Decisions tab once you have 1 colonist.

You can end up finding nothing, or perhaps you'll find some small reward... or maybe you will discover a long lost monument deep in the jungles!\n\nIf you do discover a monument, its location will be revealed to you and you will get a permanent claim in that province.

Your choice of candidate will become the new Queen of Castile, and you may even get an alliance with the country she came from if they support her.\n\nHowever, the country you did not choose may contest your decision and declare war for the throne. It is also possible that neither country will want to support their claimant, in which case all you'll have to do is defeat the pretender rebels for the disaster to end.\n\nIf you do have to fight a war, regardless of whether you win or lose, the disaster will end when the war ends.

For example, since the Renaissance institution is already present at game start, countries that do not have it will have a harder time researching tech 4.\n\nSince ages were also tied to institutions, the requirements for the start of a new age have also been changed.
