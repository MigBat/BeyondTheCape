 btc_startscreen.2_d:0 "Portugal has new ideas, missions, provinces, terrain and trade goods. There is also a new trade node called Lisboa. Portugal has the ability to create trade posts to simulate the feitoria system. There is a new holy order unique to Portugal - the Order of Christ.\n\nThere are two unique decisions for Portugal related to the special units Caravel and Galleon. One decision changes Caravels into Square-Rigged Caravels - a more expensive, combat-oriented caravel - and the other decision changes Galleons into Naus, giving the ability to transport units, sacrificing combat power. Portugal no longer starts with a historical friendship with Castile, so be on your toes!"\n\nThe Portuguese Monarchy government also have a new mechanic called Saudade. It starts at zero. It is increased or decreased based on the idea groups you pick (check their bonuses) and the decisions you take that affect it."

 btc_startscreen.3_t:0 "Exploration"
 btc_startscreen.3_d:0 "The exploration system has been changed a bit from how it works in vanilla. For starters, exploration ideas no longer have the Quest for the New World idea, so you will not be able to explore just by picking that idea group. However, you will require that idea group if you want to explore.\n\nWhen you reach diplomatic tech 7 while having exploration ideas, an event will fire giving you the ability to hire explorers, conquistadors and sailing the high seas. Portugal and Castile have an advantage here. Portugal already starts with an explorer, and through their mission tree they will be able to acquire new ones. They will, however, be unable to discover the new world and can only sail around Africa.\n\nThey will have the chance to get the Christopher Columbus event if the year is 1480 and Portugal has not discovered the Cape of Good Hope. If they have, then Castile will get the event once they conquer Granada. This means that either Portugal or Castile will be able to discover the new world roughly 10 years before any other country if the conditions are met.\n\nThe Caribbean region is no longer a colonial region, so the Treaty of Tordesillas will no longer have any effect on countries wanting to colonize there."

 btc_startscreen.5_d:0 "The triggers for the disaster to fire are exactly the same as before, but the consequences are much more dire. You get -5% discipline for the duration of the disaster, as well as -65% land forcelimit and global manpower. When it fires you are given two options - to support the Portuguese candidate Joanna, or the Aragonese candidate Isabella. Your choice will become the new Queen of Castile, and you may even get an alliance with the country she came from.\n\nHowever, the country you did not choose may contest your decision and declare war for the throne. Due to the morale malus you've incurred, it is paramount that you fight this war with diplomacy. It is also possible that neither country will want to support their claimant, in which case all you'll have to do is defeat the pretender rebels for the disaster to end.\n\nIf you do have to fight a war, regardless of whether you win or lose, the disaster will end when the war ends and you will share an heir with the country you are allied to. This heir may be the one to unite the two countries in a personal union."

 btc_startscreen.6_d:0 "When Castile gets the civil war disaster, they will have to choose between Portugal and Aragon. If they choose Portugal, we can press the claim or ignore it. Regardless, Joanna will become Queen of Castile and Aragon will get an event to contest that claim, and they may declare war on Castile, and we will be called to war if we pressed our claim.\n\nFrance will also get an event in which they can choose to support us, but they won't be called to war. When the war ends, if we win then our monarch will be Castile's consort and Joanna will become our consort and Castile's ruler. We both get an heir named Isabel. This heir may be the one to unite the two countries in a personal union."
