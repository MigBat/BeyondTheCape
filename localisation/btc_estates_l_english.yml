 estate_slavers_desc:0 "This estate represents the merchants that specialize in the slave trade, acquiring them in the western coast of Africa, and selling them to the highest bidder. The usual fate of these slaves is to be sold to plantation owners in the New World, working there for the rest of their lives. This practice of sending slaves from Africa to the New World has come to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade."

Making use of their many hard-earned privileges as well as the many debts owed to them, they have effectively seized the reins of government and turned the $MONARCHTITLE$ into little more than their puppet."
 estate_disasters.30.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."

 slavers_estate_events.1.t:0 "Advancement of the Slaver Guilds"
 slavers_estate_events.1.d:0 "The Slavers have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking the profit to again expand their businesses. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control of the coins the Slavers have managed to increase their power over our country."
 slavers_estate_events.1.a:0 "Ok."
 slavers_estate_events.2.t:0 "Decline of the Slaver Guilds"
 slavers_estate_events.2.d:0 "The status and influence of the Slavers is rarely quite as secure as that of those born into power. Lately a combination of financial misfortune and misdirected political ambitions have resulted in a loss of power and influence for the Slavers of [Root.GetName]."
 slavers_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 slavers_estate_events.3.t:0 "Outside Competition"
 slavers_estate_events.3.d:0 "Slave trading is not always without conflict. It seems rich merchants in some of our Slaver-dominated cities have been attempting to bypass various guild privileges by outsourcing work to brigands living outside the city. The fact that this has been a very profitable strategy only further enflames the anger of the other slavers in the city, who feel their rights have been trampled and that the carefully managed prices of their slaves will suffer. The Slavers now turn to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to defend their privileges as the city council has been unable to root out competition from the brigands."
 slavers_estate_events.3.a:0 "We should avoid interference."
 slavers_estate_events.3.b:0 "We must safeguard the guild privileges."

 slavers_estate_events.5.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] state has allied with a number of wealthy Slaver guilds. They have been granted positions in the administration, control over shipping routes, and preferential treatment in the taxation system. Our heavy patronage has at last paid off; they have offered us the service of a number of skilled financiers to aid our administration, and donated a large sum to our coffers. The workings of the state now run as smoothly as they ever have."
 slavers_estate_events.5.a:0 "How very generous."
 slavers_estate_events.6.t:0 "Social Banditry"
 slavers_estate_events.6.d:0 "A host of social and economic problems in the [Root.GetAdjective] trade companies have led to an eruption of highway banditry throughout the realm's overseas domains. Banditry has become so prolific that some cities have not received a single slave ship in months.\n\nSeveral bandit leaders are seen as folk heroes by the local populace, bravely resisting the rule of the parasitic state of [Root.Country.GetName], founding new frontier towns, and recruiting local labor. Drawing into their ranks Fetishists and Muslims, toddy-tappers and smiths, the bandits have attracted widespread support.\n\nA direct military confrontation with the bandits would solve the immediate problem if we could root them out from their makeshift forts. However, the problem is only likely to resurface if we do not address the social and economic factors that make the bandits powerful and popular."
 slavers_estate_events.6.a:0 "Kill them all!"
 slavers_estate_events.6.b:0 "Address the social causes of banditry."
