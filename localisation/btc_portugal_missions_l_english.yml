 btc_ordenacoes_desc: "Our young King will soon take up his father's throne, closely guarded by his uncle, the Duke of Coimbra.

They shall also serve as a guide for explorers to know they are on the right path."

By arming them with swords painted in black, we prevent reflected light from betraying their presence on ships, as well as to mitigate corrosion caused by salt water. The protective rings are shaped in such a way that they can simultaneously guard the bearer's fingers, trap an opponent's blade, and are sharp enough to be used as extra blades in close combat."

He's recently concluded overseeing the colonization of the Azores islands and now wishes to focus on charting the african coast. For this endeavour, he has gathered the best navigators and map-makers of the country at his villa in the town of Sagres in the Algarve province. Here, the Sagres School of Navigation was founded."

When in the middle of uncharted waters, the mariner must be equipped with precise equipment that allows him to know exactly where he is at any time. Planispheric astrolabes have proven useless in rough water and in heavy winds, dangers we are sure to face. However, by making a few modifications to this device, and adding an alidade to measure vertical angles, one is able to determine the latitude of a ship at sea by measuring the sun's declination or the meridian altitude of a star of known declination."

This is but a rudimentary design though, with much to be improved. If we are to dominate commerce along the shores of Africa, we need fast and maneuverable ships to protect our trading vessels, along with a sturdy build of the finest wood to endure long exploration voyages in the unpredictability of the ocean."

Pedro is the current Regent of the realm, overseeing the education of the young King, his nephew. Henrique is the Grandmaster of the Order of Christ, and at the forefront of nautical innovation. João was the Constable of the country. Fernando, Grandmaster of the Order of Aviz, became a martyr after his untimely death in Moroccan custody after being taken prisoner in the failed siege of Tangiers in 1437. Of these only Pedro and Henrique remain, and their presence in court seems to be coming to an end as Afonso, Duke of Bragança and one of the wealthiest men in Portugal and Europe, has been turning the King against their uncles."

If we reinforce the hull with different types of high-quality wood, it will have higher all-around resistance to the elements, as well as cannonball fire and ramming.

They were vital during the Reconquista, and continue to be so in our recent african incursions - the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 being the latest high, and the defeat at Tangiers in 1437 the most recent low.
