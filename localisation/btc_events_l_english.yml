 btc_events.16_d:0 "A country's settler pool represents its ability to send people over to newly colonized provinces. It goes without saying that countries with a higher population have more people to send, and thus the bigger a country is the more capable they are at sending more people overseas.\n\nEvery country has a maximum number of possible settlers. This is determined by the number of state provinces they have as well as total development.\n\nThe base value for the settler pool is 1000 for every country. To that is added the total number of state provinces times 30. Further to that is added the total development of the country times 2.\n\nEach colony a country is developing reduces the pool by 1000. Once the colony is complete, the 1000 will be replenished to the pool.\n\nThere are a number of modifiers related to how many free settlers you have in comparison to the total settler pool:\n\nMany Settlers: over 2000 settlers. This gives you +25 global colonial growth and +5% colonist placement chance.\nSome Settlers: between 1000 and 1999 settlers. This gives you +10 global colonial growth.\nLow Settlers: between 500 and 999 settlers. This gives you -10 global colonial growth.\nVery Low Settlers: between 1 and 499 settlers. This gives you -25 global colonial growth and -5% colonist placement chance.\nNo Settlers: 0 or less settlers. This gives you -50 global colonial growth, -10% colonist placement chance and +50% colony cost."

The destruction caused was catastrophic, sweeping away buildings, ships, and people alike. The waves reached heights of over 6 meters in some areas, smashing through the lower floors of buildings and sweeping residents out to sea.

The first option is to completely abandon Lisbon and rebuild a new city elsewhere. The second option is to not make any major changes to Lisbon and instead focus on repairing and rebuilding the existing infrastructure and buildings. The third option is to rebuild Lisbon in the same location, but with significant improvements to building codes, making the city more resilient to future disasters.
