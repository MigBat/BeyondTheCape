 btc_irmandinos.1_d:0 "Increasing economic and social pressures are affecting the lower classes in Galician society. Many of the peasants and artisans are struggling to make ends meet in a region dominated by a powerful and wealthy nobility. In response to these conditions, the Irmandade das Marés was formed, drawing support from a wide range of social classes, advocating for greater suppport for the poor and marginalized. They started sieging our forts in Galicia and the nobility is asking for our help in stopping them. This could prove to be a good opportunity to weaken the nobles of the region. Should we allow the rebels to have their way, we could establish a direct administration there."

# Lisbon Earthquake #
 lisbon_earthquake:0 "The coast of Portugal and Morocco are devastated, particularly the Estremadura area"
 btc_por.1_t:0 "The Great Earthquake of $YEAR$"
 btc_por.1_d:0 "On this day, a devastating earthquake struck the city of Lisbon, capital of Portugal. The quake was felt as far away as Morocco and caused widespread damage, destroying many buildings and claiming countless lives. Survivors describe the ground heaving up and down like waves, and buildings collapsing like sandcastles. The death toll is estimated to be in the thousands, and the city is left in a state of chaos and despair. The aftershocks continue to rattle the city, and the people of Lisbon must come together to rebuild their homes and their lives in the wake of this terrible tragedy."
 btc_por.1A:0 "Immediately evacuate Lisbon"
 btc_por.1B:0 "Lead the people to the open spaces of the central plaza"
 btc_por.1C:0 "The safety of the royal family is of the utmost priority"
 btc_por.2_t:0 "The Wrath of the Ocean"
 btc_por.2_d:0 "In the aftermath of the earthquake, massive waves surged up the Tagus River, engulfing much of the city's harbor and waterfront areas. The destruction caused was catastrophic, sweeping away buildings, ships, and people alike. The waves reached heights of over 6 meters in some areas, smashing through the lower floors of buildings and sweeping residents out to sea. The loss of life was staggering, and the impact on the city's infrastructure was immense."
 btc_por.2A:0 "Why did God allow this to happen?"
 btc_por.3_t:0 "The Ensuing Fires"
 btc_por.3_d:0 "A series of fires have spread throughout the city, engulfing buildings and leaving many without homes or shelter. As we survey the damage and those affect, we must decide how to respond to this tragedy."

 btc_por.3D:0 "Focus on salvaging our valuable goods"
 btc_por.4_t:0 "Marquês de Pombal"
 btc_por.4_d:0 "Literally from the ashes of Lisboa, a new leader rose to the power and managed to shake entire Portugal out of the trauma caused by the earthquake. He forced through many far reaching reforms. During his rule Lisboa was rebuilt and Portugal entered into the pre-industrial era. In many ways his excellent governing would, for a time, bring back Portugal almost to its former level of glory a few hundred years back."
 btc_por.4A:0 "An excellent minister"
 btc_por.5_t:0 "The Aftermath"
 btc_por.5_d:0 "As the dust settles and the city begins to assess the damage, it becomes clear that the destruction is widespread and severe. Homes and buildings lie in ruins, the streets are littered with debris, and many are injured, homeless, or without basic necessities. Trade routes have been disrupted, infratructure made useless, and economic instability threats to worsen with each passing day."

 btc_por.6_t:0 "The Looting"
 btc_por.6_d:0 "Most citizens sought safety, yet some saw the existing chaos as an opportunity for personal gain. Reports have surfaced of widespread looting throughout the city, as individuals took advantage of the destruction to steal goods and valuables. Valuable resources were seized and hoarded by those who had them, leaving many without the basic necessities for survival."
 btc_por.6A:0 "There is barely anything to loot anyway"
 btc_por.6B:0 "Make a show of force"
 btc_por.6C:0 "The situation changes nothing on proper procedure"
 btc_por.7_t:0 "Recovery Efforts"
 btc_por.7_d:0 "Your advisors report that recovery efforts are underway, with teams of workers and volunteers working tirelessly to clear the rubble and provide aid to those in need. Efforts are also being made to reestablish infrastructure and services, and to restore damaged buildings and landmarks."
 btc_por.7A:0 "The Crown will personally handle the situation"

 btc_por.8_t:0 "The Reconstruction of Lisbon"
 btc_por.8_d:0 "Manuel da Maia, a prominent engineer and architect, outlines four potential courses of action for the future of the city. The first option is to completely abandon Lisbon and rebuild a new city elsewhere. The second option is to not make any major changes to Lisbon and instead focus on repairing and rebuilding the existing infrastructure and buildings. The third option is to rebuild Lisbon in the same location, but with significant improvements to building codes, making the city more resilient to future disasters. The fourth option would rebuild the city with changes to the layout and design to improve its functionality and aesthetics. This would require a significant investment in urban planning and architecture."
 btc_por.8A:0 "Build a new capital"
 btc_por.8B:0 "Rebuild the old city"

 btc_por.91A:0 "Belém is the new capital"
 btc_por.92_t:0 "Lisbon Rebuilt"
 btc_por.92_d:0 "We have managed to rebuild the city as it was before the earthquake struck, preserving its history and cultural heritage, as well as a desire to maintain continuity and stability for the portuguese people."
 btc_por.92A:0 "Lisbon is rebuilt to its former glory"
 btc_por.93_t:0 "A Modern City"
 btc_por.93_d:0 "The rebuilding of Lisbon with wider streets was a massive undertaking, requiring significant resources and expertise. The end result was a city that was more spacious, more efficient, and more modern than before, with wider streets that could accomodate larger vehicles and more pedestrians."
 btc_por.93A:0 "Streets are widened"
 btc_por.94_t:0 "Baixa Pombalina"
 btc_por.94_d:0 "The project is complete. The result is a grand and spacious district that features wide boulevards, grand plazas, and elegant buildings.

 btc_por.100_d:0 "The faithful of the Lord have vanquished the invading infidels from our land, but some of their ilk still lurk amidst us, hiding in the shadows, scheming and deceiving while practicing their own wicked ways. We have won the holy war, but our holy task will never be completed while they still wander free amongst us. They must be sent back to the desert from whence they came!"

 btc_por.101_t:0 "The Matter of Overseas Policy"
 btc_por.101_d:0 "It has become evidently clear that the future of Portugal lies on the deck of its ships, overseas. However, such endevour requires an organized and methodical approach. We need a single and cohesive voice abroad in order to be truly respected, or feared."
 btc_por.101a:0 "We must prioritize the building of trust and reputation between our partners"
 btc_por.101b:0 "We must protect our interests, by force if necessary"
 btc_por.103_t:0 "Atlantic Slave Trade"
 btc_por.103_d:0 "For many centuries, the islamic powers have profited a great deal in slave labour across the Sahara. With the discovery of new lands and new resources, we are in dire need of human resources to explore this untapped wealth, and if we are ambitious enough, we can serve as the middle-man for other christians who might follow our trail."
 btc_por.103a:0 "Encourage slave trade from Africa"
 btc_por.103b:0 "We should regulate these practices"
 btc_por.104_t:0 "Captains acting independently from the crown"
 btc_por.104_d:0 "It is almost an inevitability that once our captains find themselves half a world away from their suzerain, with a fleet and army at their hands, and plenty of exotic riches and pleasures surrounding them, that they might might take some "creative liberties" into their own hands... and pockets."
 btc_por.104a:0 "Our subjects must act strictly according to the crown's wishes"
 btc_por.104b:0 "What can one do?"
 btc_por.105_t:0 "Security of the Empire"
 btc_por.105_d:0 "Our empire is one of an unconventional kind. Rather than a contiguous swathe of land, it consists of a plethora of forts, cities and ports across the seven seas. Naturally this comes with a cost. To make sure the empire remains secure and functional, we require taking some measures, in the form of either strong and ready local garrisons or standing fleets ready to support any corner in need, at a moment's notice."
 btc_por.105a:0 "Increase our garrisons"
 btc_por.105b:0 "Invest in strong fleets"
 btc_por.105c:0 "It's going to be fine!"
 btc_por.106_t:0 "Bankrupcy of the Antwerpen Factory"
 btc_por.106_d:0 "Our oldest trade factory in Europe has recently began struggling to compete with their dutch and jewish rivals in Antwerpen. We cannot ignore the issue for any longer, something has to be done in regards to our facilities or they will surely go bankrupt."
 btc_por.106a:0 "It's not worth salvaging"
 btc_por.106b:0 "The factory is too big to fail"
 btc_por.107_t:0 "Crusade against Infidels in Africa"
 btc_por.107_d:0 "Our king has dreamt of a great crusade, on the heartlands of the Maghreb itself. Now more than ever is the time to act, for the Ottoman Turks spread their influence in Africa like a ravenous jackal. The time of caution and small gains is over. God is on our side, we have demonstrated the superiority in valor and arms. Morocco shall tremble at the sight of our pikes."
 btc_por.107a:0 "By the grace of God!"
 btc_por.107b:0 "Crusades are a thing of the past"
 btc_por.108_t:0 "Casa da India can't cover its expenses"
 btc_por.108_d:0 "Our commercial enterprise in India has recently been struggling to provide a profit that compensates their hefty expenses. Some in the court suggest we should follow the English and Dutch examples and sell the company to private citizens. Surely they simply want to profit at the expense of the Crown's hard-earned efforts, why should we believe they would be any more competent than His Royal Highness?"
 btc_por.108a:0 "The state cannot afford to lose its most valuable asset"
 btc_por.108b:0 "Perhaps it's time to sell it to the highest bidder"
 btc_por.109_t:0 "A Matter of National Defense"
 btc_por.109_d:0 "The enemy has set foot in our homeland and will not stop until they see the Portuguese spirit broken and subjugated. We are a proud and free people who refuse to be dominated by any foreign power, we will do whatever it takes to defend our homeland, and see the enemy beaten and driven from our soil."
 btc_por.109a:0 "Victory, or death!"
 btc_por.109b:0 "It's not worth gambling our future away"
 btc_por.110_t:0 "The reliance on Brazilian gold"
 btc_por.110_d:0 "Fortune smiles upon us! We have recently found large deposits of gold in the Brazilian countryside, the locals have already began flocking to the area to claim their earthly wealth. The Crown should step in and take its rightful share."
 btc_por.110a:0 "This is God's reward for our unshakable faith"
 btc_por.110b:0 "We should not be fooled by shiny metals"
 btc_por.111_t:0 "A golden age for our culture"
 btc_por.111_d:0 "The Brazilian gold has proven to be a great boost to our economy. Once again Portugal is a beacon of wealth and culture, the envy of the Western World. A bright golden future lies ahead of us."
 btc_por.111a:0 "We should keep this newfound wealth safe in our treasury"
 btc_por.111b:0 "We should use this gold to display our wealth"
 btc_por.111c:0 "We should use this wealth to send embassiers to our friends"
 btc_por.112_t:0 "Over-reliance on Brazilian gold"
 btc_por.112_d:0 "The price of gold seems to have dropped dramatically faster than predicted, and the value of the Portuguese Real has plumeted across European markets. We should have been more careful with the coin minting."
 btc_por.112a:0 "The writing was on the wall"
 btc_por.113_t:0 "The Methuen Agreement"
 btc_por.113_d:0 "Our good friends, the English, have proposed a treaty where English cotton would be sold at the Portuguese markets free of tariffs, in exchange of Portuguese wine being sold in English markets with tariffs three times lower compared to French wines."
 btc_por.113a:0 "Sign the treaty"
 btc_por.113b:0 "Denounce the treaty"
 btc_por.114_t:0 "Expulsion of the Jesuits"
 btc_por.114_d:0 "The Jesuits have for long dominated the educational sistem of Portugal, and as a result they have acquired a dangerous amount of influence and power amongst the learned classes. We cannot allow this behaviour to continue, or we will be intelectual hostages to the Jesuit will."
 btc_por.114a:0 "Expel the Jesuits"
 btc_por.114b:0 "Do not expel them"
 btc_por.115_t:0 "The Ban on Slavery"
 btc_por.115_d:0 "It has become intolerable for the Portuguese Crown to continue proclaiming itself a champion of enlightenment values while still inflicting the most grievous kind of attack on human dignity and right by the practice of trade in human stock. Our good friends the British have already abolished such a henious practice and now struggle to abolish it across their empire, and the world. We are already under diplomatic pressure to do the same, and it is quite frankly humiliating to remain obstinate in this matter."
 btc_por.115a:0 "It is simply too profitable"
 btc_por.115b:0 "Ban slaver trade on the metropole"
 btc_por.115c:0 "Ban all slave trade"
 btc_por.116_t:0 "Viradeira"
 btc_por.116_d:0 "The radical policies of the Marquis of Pombal have shaken the stability and function of the most ancient and well established Portuguese institutions. Although he pushed for innovative and modernising reforms, he acquired a dangerous taste for power and lost measure and restraint, and steered the country in a direction that endangers our very social fabric. We cannot allow our country to continue threading this tumultous and irresponsible path."
 btc_por.116a:0 "What is done is done"
 btc_por.116b:0 "We have to go back"
 btc_por.117_t:0 "Enemies closing in on Lisbon"
 btc_por.117_d:0 "Enemy forces have invaded our nation and are quickly advancing towards Lisbon. We must make sure all matters are arranged to ensure the Royal Family remains outside of the enemy grasp, for whoever controls the King, controls the Kingdom."

 btc_por.118a:0 "It's a disaster!"
 btc_por.119_t:0 "Decree of Open Ports to Friendly Nations"
 btc_por.119_d:0 "It has become unsustainable that in a global world our colonial subjects remain hindered by artificial limitations to trading with other nations. We will not be able to limit their potential in this way forever, it is better to act benevolently than to have our hand forced at a later date."
 btc_por.119a:0 "Never!"
 btc_por.119b:0 "We have no alternative" 
 btc_por.120_t:0 "Ribeira Palace"

 btc_por.127_t:0 "The Portuguese in Goa"
 btc_por.127_d:0 "Foreign ships are spotted in the horizon, vessels larger than any we'd seen before. They set port and its sailors are brought to us by local fishermen they traded with. They claim to be Portuguese explorers who sailed around Africa in search of indian riches. Surely they jest, but what caught our attention was their offer to establish a trading post in Goa to initiate mercantile activities with us. Should we take them up on that offer?"
 btc_por.127a:0 "Allow them to establish a base in Goa."
 btc_por.127b:0 "These charlatans cannot be trusted."
 btc_por.128_t:0 "The Purchase of Goa"
 btc_por.128_d:0 "We have secured a meeting with the local Zamorin.
