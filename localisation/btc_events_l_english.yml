 btc_gra.1_d:0 "Parias are a form of tribute paid by the taifas of al-Andalus to the Christian kingdoms of the north. They were a form of protection money established by treaty. The payee owed the tributary military protection against foes both Islamic and Christian. Usually the original exaction was forced, either by a large razzia or the threat of one, or as the cost of supporting one Islamic party against another."

With the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean it seems uncertain if anyone can be safe at sea anymore. We have received repeated reports of shipping being raided by Christian ships lately. These pirates threaten the trade that our Sultanate lives from and must be stopped. Perhaps it would be wise to contact the Sultan of Constantinople to discuss a possible alliance against these Christian pirates?"
