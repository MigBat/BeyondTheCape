### Portuguese Regency ###

 portuguese_regency: "The Bragança Plot"
 portuguese_regency_desc: "The Duke of Bragança plots to take power for himself by influencing the young heir Afonso against Infante Pedro, the regent of the country. A bellicose man, should he succeed Portugal's future goals may alter drastically. The fate of the country shall be decided when young Afonso ascends to the throne."

 portuguese_regency.1_t: "The Bragança Plot"
 portuguese_regency.1_d: "The untimely death of King Duarte I plunged the country into a contrived regency, with his brothers - the Illustrious Generation - striving to keep snakes at court from gaining power. Yet João suddenly died in 1442, and Fernando perished in a Moroccan cell in 1443, deeply saddening and weakening the remaining two brothers, Pedro the Regent and Henrique the Navigator.\n\nSensing blood, Afonso - a half-brother of the Illustrious - schemes to gain power and influence over the young King. Having already been bestowed the title of Duke of Bragança, his ambitions seem limitless.\n\nAppease him, and he gains considerable power.\nDo not, and the worst may happen.\n\nThe time for difficult choices is upon us..."
 portuguese_regency.1a: "For the sake of Portugal."

 show_afonso_alignment_tt: "[Root.GetAfonsoAlignment]"
 btc_afonso_pleased: "The Duke of Bragança is currently pleased with the privileges given so far."
 btc_afonso_displeased: "The Duke of Bragança is currently displeased with the privileges given so far."

 portuguese_regency.2_t: "The Future Consort"
 portuguese_regency.2_d: "Assuring the dynasty's survival is of paramount importance, and for that a proper consort must be selected. This is also a great opportunity to form important political alliances, or consolidate one's power within the realm. This is exactly what Afonso, Duke of Bragança, had in mind when he suggested to Infante Pedro that the young King marry one of his granddaughters. However, Infante Pedro has a daughter of his own, the same age as young Afonso..."
 portuguese_regency.2a: "Pedro's daughter shall be consort."
 braganca_offended_tt: "§MThe Duke of Bragança will be offended.§!"
 portuguese_regency.2b: "Afonso's daughter shall be consort."
 braganca_pleased_tt: "§MThe Duke of Bragança will be pleased.§!"
 portuguese_regency.3_t: "Leonor Returns"
 portuguese_regency.3_d: "Before Infante Pedro became regent, it was young Afonso's mother, Leonor of Aragon, who oversaw state affairs and her son's education. Although she was the rightful regent as per the will of our late King Duarte I and had the support of the nobility, her appointment was not a popular one amongst the people due to her being a woman - and a foreigner. Due to a combination of this and the poor health and sorrow she suffered due to the death of one of her daughters, in 1440 the regency was awarded to Infante Pedro and Leonor fled to Castile.\n\nYet now she seeks to return to Portugal, claiming a deep unhappiness due to the separation with her children. While control over the country is firmly in Infante Pedro's grasp, Leonor has proved herself to be a cunning woman. She may be speaking the truth, or this may be yet another one of her plots."
 portuguese_regency.3a: "No more. Dispose of her discreetly."
 portuguese_regency.3b: "A mother should not be separated from her children."
 portuguese_regency.4_t: "A Promise of Titles"
 portuguese_regency.4_d: "When Infante João and Infante Fernando died, their respective titles of Constable of Portugal and Grandmaster of the Order of Avis were vacated - two of the most powerful and prestigious positions in the country. These titles had been promised to Afonso's sons when he was made Duke of Bragança in 1442, and he expects this promise to be fulfilled. Much has changed since then though, and giving more power to House Bragança may not be wise. It could perhaps be safer to give these titles to Infante Pedro's sons instead."
 portuguese_regency.4a: "These titles must remain in House Avis."
 portuguese_regency.4b: "A promise is a promise."
 portuguese_regency.5_t: "Funds for the Realm"
 portuguese_regency.5_d: "Every so often we find ourselves with a surplus of funds, which goes to show how efficient our policies have been. We can thus save up for future investments, or we can use this opportunity to gain favour with House Bragança by allocating these funds to their lands."
 portuguese_regency.5a: "Let's save up."
 portuguese_regency.5b: "Award these funds to House Bragança."
 portuguese_regency.6_t: "Distributing the Land"
 portuguese_regency.6_d: "One of the jobs of a ruler is to make sure all our land is being properly managed. We have recently come to learn that a corrupt mayor has been making shady deals, resulting in complaints from the local peasants. Naturally, he has been dismissed from his post, which presents an opportunity to mend relations within the country."
 portuguese_regency.6a: "Appoint a renowned and loyal subject"
 portuguese_regency.6b: "Appoint a member of House Bragança"
 portuguese_regency.10_t: "Now Come the Days of The King"
 portuguese_regency.10_d1: "For long has the Duke of Bragança poisoned the mind of the King against Infante Pedro. Bitter with resentment over decisions not in his favor, he managed to convince the King to relieve Infante Pedro of his duties and repeal most of his policies, as well as declaring him a traitor and usurper. Now Pedro seeks to defend his honor and rejects these accusations. He has assembled his retinue, along with longtime friend Álvaro Vaz de Almada, and marches to Lisboa for an audience with Afonso V.\n\nThe King, however, is convinced he intends to take the throne for himself, and assembles his army to meet Pedro in battle."
 portuguese_regency.10_d2: "We have fulfilled our promises to House Bragança, and conceded them many titles and rights. Thus we have made an ally out of Duke Afonso and assured House Avis remains in power, at the cost of making House Bragança the wealthiest in the realm. At least for now, there can be peace."
 portuguese_regency.10a: "You have no power here."
 portuguese_regency.10b: "To new beginnings."
 portuguese_regency.100_t: "May They be Blessed"
 portuguese_regency.100_d1: "And so ends the tumultuous regency of Infante Pedro, making place for Afonso V to shape the future of Portugal, with the Duke of Bragança by his side. Henrique has left Lisboa and isolated himself in Sagres, from where he continues sending expeditions down the African coast. But he's an old relic, let him play with his boats. We have grander prizes on our sights."
 portuguese_regency.100_d2: "This day does not belong to one man, but to all. Let us together rebuild this country that we may share in the days of peace. Out of the Great Womb to Portugal I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world."
 portuguese_regency.100a: "Onwards and upwards."
 portuguese_regency.100b: "Together we shall prosper."
 children_of_pedro_tt: "§YThe children of Infante Pedro go into exile in Burgundy§!"

 portuguese_regency.101_t: "The Rights of House Bragança"
 portuguese_regency.101_d: "The Duke of Bragança greets the new King. With him be brings an entourage with the finest wines from the north, and alheiras from Bragança. They exchange stories and laughs are shared. A really great evening all things considered.\nThen the duke changes the subject to that of the rights of House Bragança, won by his late ancestor. He seeks to assure House Bragança remains the strongest in the realm."
 portuguese_regency.101a: "I am not my father."
 portuguese_regency.101b: "I'm sure we can work something out..."

 portuguese_regency.102_t: "John, Prince of Antioch"
 portuguese_regency.102_d: "When Infante Pedro was killed in battle, his children fled to Burgundy under the safe watch of Isabel, Queen-consort of Burgundy and sister of Pedro. She ensured they would have a proper education.\n\nBeatriz married a nephew of Philip the Good.\nJaime was promoted to a cardinal at only 23 years of age.\nAnd finally, João was made a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece has married Charlotte de Lusignan of Cyprus, who today has risen to the throne of the country.\n\nIf we play our cards right, and manage to mend relations with João, we may get an opportunity to get closer to the last crusader state."
 portuguese_regency.102a: "An interesting development..."
 john_antioch_tt: "§MIf we get high enough relations §Y(100)§! with @CYP Cyprus, perhaps we can strike some sort of arrangement with them. Of course, João needs to be alive for this to happen...§!"

 portuguese_regency.103_t: "The Crusader King(dom)"
 portuguese_regency.103_d: "Our efforts have paid off and João, King-consort of Cyprus, has put the matter of his father's death to rest, for the greater good of the realm. Many meetings have been had between him and our diplomats at Cyprus, and knowing full well that their Kingdom is at risk, they have come forth with two proposals. It is up to us now to decide how we shall support Cyprus."
 portuguese_regency.103a: "Suggest they become our march"
 portuguese_regency.103b: "Guarantee their independence"

 portuguese_regency.104_t: "An Offer from Portugal"
 portuguese_regency.104_d: "We have received a delegation from Portugal, the home country of our King-consort João. They propose we become a march under them, as they consider us too weak to survive on our own and achieve the ambition of reclaiming the Holy Land. They are not entirely wrong, although hearing it like that is not very pleasant. Still, we do need to protect our people. What shall we do?"
 portuguese_regency.104a: "We accept"
 portuguese_regency.104b: "We refuse"

# Portugal Liberal Wars #

 portuguese_liberalism.1_t: "Brazil Declares Independence"
 portuguese_liberalism.1_d: "Pedro has decided to abdicate as ruler of Portugal and instead chooses to reign over Brazil, declaring the independence of the former colony. He has named his daughter Maria as the next ruler of Portugal. Until she comes of age, the regency will be given to Pedro's younger brother Miguel.\n\nHowever, there is division in the court as to the legitimacy of such move, and the loss of Brazil as an importance source of revenue is massively damaging to Portugal. Not only that, but both Pedro and Maria follow liberal values, vastly contrasting with the absolutists of the country. Many would not welcome such a radical change of values."
 portuguese_liberalism.1a: "Uncertain times..."

 portuguese_liberalism.2_t: "Miguel Declares Himself King"
 portuguese_liberalism.2_d: "With support from the estates that refuse to accept liberal values, Miguel has taken over the throne of Portugal. He claims that since Pedro abdicated his claim to the throne of Portugal, he no longer has a right to name a successor, and thus the claim falls to the next in line which would be Miguel himself.\n\nMaria's supporters have risen all over the country, with violent conflicts erupting between the liberals and absolutists. Maria has also sent an envoy to Brazil informing of the situation and asking for aid. We can except Pedro to mount an offensive any day now."
