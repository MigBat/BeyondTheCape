 btc_seven_cities.1_t:0 "The Crossroads"
 btc_seven_cities.1_d:0 "As we follow the map to El Dorado, we come across an area that is not depicted there. We have followed the instructions to the letter and there is no way we took a wrong turn. Could it be that the map is incomplete. Regardless, we cannot linger for long. There are three paths to take:\n\nThe path to the left, from where a cool breeze blows.\nThe path straight ahead, where the jungle grows thicker.\nThe path to the right, where the sun shines bright."
 btc_seven_cities.1a:0 "Go left"
 btc_seven_cities.1b:0 "Go straight ahead"
 btc_seven_cities.1c:0 "Go right"
 btc_seven_cities.2_t:0 "The Clearing"
 btc_seven_cities.2_d:0 "Our expedition soon reaches a clearing, away from the poisonous plants and bugs of the jungle. The men are tired and the sun will set soon. This is a good place for camping, but we've hardly made half a day's journey. What should we do?"
 btc_seven_cities.2a:0 "Make camp"
 btc_seven_cities.2b:0 "Keep going"
 btc_seven_cities.2c:0 "Send some men ahead while the rest camp"
 btc_seven_cities.3_t:0 "The Puzzle"
 btc_seven_cities.3_d:0 "We soon reach some sort of ancient construction taken over by moss. The stones seem to depict animals, the likes of which we have never seen before. There are carvings of a hunting scene and some sort of ceremony. As we continue following the rocks and uncovering more and more of this ancient structure, one of our men shouts from inside claiming to have found something.\nIt looks like a large stone door, but locked without any sort of visible mechanism to open it. There's a piece of wood sticking out of the wall to the left of this door. Could it be some sort of mechanism to open it?"
 btc_seven_cities.3a:0 "Push it into the wall"
 btc_seven_cities.3b:0 "Pull it out of the wall"
 btc_seven_cities.3c:0 "Rotate it clockwise"
 btc_seven_cities.4_t:0 "The Natives of $PROVINCENAME$"
 btc_seven_cities.4_d:0 "Our guide claims the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ have information regarding the whereabouts of the fountain, and that their ancestors even tapped into its source. Indeed, the natives we have found here seem to have perfectly clear skin, free of the wounds of time. Should this be true, we must get this information from them."
 btc_seven_cities.4a:0 "Ask them directly"
 btc_seven_cities.4b:0 "Torture them for the location"
 btc_seven_cities.4c:0 "Search for and steal their maps"
 btc_seven_cities.5_t:0 "The Sunken Ship"
 btc_seven_cities.5_d:0 "Off the coast of $PROVINCENAME$ there is a sunken ship. It looks like it's been here for a century, but how could this be? It is clearly some sort of cog, a very european design. Could this be an adventurer that somehow managed to cross the ocean in this sorry excuse of a vessel?\nOne of our crewmen spot what looks like a grave and an inscription that our translator reads as "The fountain consumed me. Here I will rest". Could this be referring to the Fountain of Youth? Did this man cross the ocean to seek it?"
 btc_seven_cities.5a:0 "Dig the grave and search the corpse"
 btc_seven_cities.5b:0 "Dive into the ship and confiscate its cargo"
 btc_seven_cities.5c:0 "This is a bad omen, we should move"
 btc_seven_cities.6_t:0 "The Behemoth"
 btc_seven_cities.6_d:0 "A school of fish accompany our ship as it maps the coasts. Suddenly, one of the sailor screams and falls onto the deck. We rush to investigate what he saw. A behemoth of a fish swims alongside the smallers ones. Oddly enough, it seems to be the same species, except it is 10 times the size of the others. Soon enough it changes course and starts swimming to shore.\nOur guide speculates that we could be close to the fountain and that the fish may have injected its waters and gained eternal life, allowing him to grow to such a ridiculous size. He could be centuries old!"
 btc_seven_cities.6a:0 "Follow that fish"
 btc_seven_cities.6b:0 "Catch it and eat it"
 btc_seven_cities.6c:0 "Catch it and study its insides"
 btc_seven_cities.7_t:0 "The Narrow Passage"
 btc_seven_cities.7_d:0 "We soon reach a narrow bridge over a deep canyon. Only one man can cross at a time. The monk refuses to go first, and so it must fall upon our conquistador to show his mettle. However, night will soon come and we see scavenger birds flying overhead and hear howls from behind the expedition. The men are growing restless and panic is sure to follow if we stay here for longer."
 btc_seven_cities.7a:0 "Cross the bridge one at a time"
 btc_seven_cities.7b:0 "We all cross together"
 btc_seven_cities.7c:0 "Let's find another way around"
 btc_seven_cities.8_t:0 "The Mass"
 btc_seven_cities.8_d:0 "Today is the holy day of Our Lady of Bakeries and Shovels, and the monk wishes to stop for a while and give a mass to the men in celebration of this day. This ought to lift their spirits, however much of our day will be lost and we'll have to make up for it afterwards."
 btc_seven_cities.8a:0 "This is nonsense, we keep going"
 btc_seven_cities.8b:0 "Let him give his mass"
 btc_seven_cities.8c:0 "Construct a small Chapel of Lady Brites."
 btc_seven_cities.9_t:0 "Aggressive Natives"
 btc_seven_cities.9_d:0 "The monk claims we are close to our destination, and tells us to be silent as sounds are heard from afar. Drums and chants, no doubt a native tribe is near. However, it sounds much like war chants and aggressive gestures and rituals. They don't seem very friendly. The monk has already gone back to our backline. What should we do?"
 btc_seven_cities.9a:0 "Attack them"
 btc_seven_cities.9b:0 "Avoid them"
 btc_seven_cities.9c:0 "Send the monk to talk to them"
 btc_seven_cities.10_t:0 "Looking for Directions"
 btc_seven_cities.10_d:0 "According to the supposed location of the city, our guides are trying to triangulate its position and the optimal path to take. If we go north, we will have to go up some hills and maybe some mountains. If we go south, we will reach some drylands with few vegetation. If we go west, we'll head through some valleys taken over by nature."
 btc_seven_cities.10a:0 "Go north"
 btc_seven_cities.10b:0 "Go south"
 btc_seven_cities.10c:0 "Go west"
 btc_seven_cities.11_t:0 "Native Knowledge"
 btc_seven_cities.11_d:0 "We spot smoke in the distance. Our scouts report a small collection of huts, no doubt belonging to native tribes. They seem to be peaceful, as no sort of weapon is visible in their encampment. Our interpreters are ready to engage them in talks, what should we do?"
 btc_seven_cities.11a:0 "Send just the interpreters"
 btc_seven_cities.11b:0 "Send the interpreters with some men"
 btc_seven_cities.11c:0 "Everyone goes to the village"
 btc_seven_cities.12_t:0 "Mountain Sight"
 btc_seven_cities.12_d:0 "There are two large mountains in the distance, and that could be our destination. We need to remember the supposed location of the city in relation to those mountains. The left is a mountain that sparkles of silver. The right mountain seems to glow golden."
 btc_seven_cities.12a:0 "Go towards the left mountain"
 btc_seven_cities.12b:0 "Go towards the right mountain"
 btc_seven_cities.12c:0 "Go between the mountains"
 btc_seven_cities.13_t:0 "The Storm"
 btc_seven_cities.13_d:0 "A huge storm has been upon us for days now. The men are tired and sickness is starting to spread. The shipwrecked crew claims this to be normal weather and that it will soon pass as we go further, but is it the right choice to continue and risk our men's lives?"
 btc_seven_cities.13a:0 "Keep going"
 btc_seven_cities.13b:0 "Shelter in a nearby cave"
 btc_seven_cities.13c:0 "Shelter under a large tree"
 btc_seven_cities.14_t:0 "Supplies"
 btc_seven_cities.14_d:0 "Our supplies are running low, and food and water seem scarce. The shipwrecked crew claim to know of a nearby spring where we can collect water. There are also some berries around, although we have never seen their kind before, and they are of very bright and enticing colours, unlike any fruit back home."
 btc_seven_cities.14a:0 "Keep going"
 btc_seven_cities.14b:0 "Collect water"
 btc_seven_cities.14c:0 "Gather berries"
 btc_seven_cities.15_t:0 "Meeting Natives"
 btc_seven_cities.15_d:0 "The shipwrecked crew lead us to a native village, where they befriended the inhabitants. Apparently they have knowledge of the location of the legendary Silver Mountains. Perhaps they could be persuaded to tell us the way."
 btc_seven_cities.15a:0 "Send the shipwrecked crew to talk to them"
 btc_seven_cities.15b:0 "We go talk to them, the shipwrecks stay behind"
 btc_seven_cities.15c:0 "Everyone goes"
 btc_seven_cities.16_t:0 "Wild Wolves"
 btc_seven_cities.16_d:0 "As the expedition passes through the woods, growling noises seem to come from all sides. We have been ambushed by a pack of wolves! Luckily we have a trapper with us who tells us exactly what to do in this situation."
 btc_seven_cities.16a:0 "Fight and kill them"
 btc_seven_cities.16b:0 "Stay still in a circle formation"
 btc_seven_cities.16c:0 "Tame them with some of our provisions"
 btc_seven_cities.17_t:0 "The Sacred Champion"
 btc_seven_cities.17_d:0 "We find a river and decide to follow it upstream. After a while, we spot a canoe with two men dressed in furs and wearing sable. This matches the description of the inhabitants of Norumbega, could they be from there? Our interpreters hail them and start talking in something similar to latin, but not quite that.\nEventually, to test if we are trustworthy, we are asked to name the sacred champion of their people. What do they mean by that? Our interpreters seem as dumbfounded as we are, however something feels familiar about this. What shall we answer?"
 btc_seven_cities.17a:0 "Porutou"
 btc_seven_cities.17b:0 "Bemfee Ka"
 btc_seven_cities.17c:0 "Boua Veeshta"
 btc_seven_cities.18_t:0 "The River"
 btc_seven_cities.18_d:0 "The river starts to widen, so much so that the margin on the opposite side is barely visible anymore, as if this is no longer a river but a large lake. We could continue on this side of the river where it is relatively hilly, or cross to the other side where there are more trees but the terrain is flatter. We could also sail upriver in canoes."
 btc_seven_cities.18a:0 "Stay on the right side"
 btc_seven_cities.18b:0 "Move to the left side"
 btc_seven_cities.18c:0 "Ready the canoes"
 btc_seven_cities.19_t:0 "The Frozen Lake"
 btc_seven_cities.19_d:0 "We come across a frozen lake. It makes cracking noises each time we take a step. We could try going around, but there is no visible passage. It could take days for all we know. What we do know though is that we need to get to the other side, question is how..."
 btc_seven_cities.19a:0 "Find a way around"
 btc_seven_cities.19b:0 "Walk slowly across the lake"
 btc_seven_cities.19c:0 "Everyone get on top of planks and push across"
 btc_seven_cities.20_t:0 "The Cave"
 btc_seven_cities.20_d:0 "A massive cave complex stands before us, and the blizzard shows no signs of stopping. The men are cold and some are getting frostbite. We cannot stay here, we must move on, either through the dark cave or over it."
 btc_seven_cities.20a:0 "Enter the cave"
 btc_seven_cities.20b:0 "Go over the cave"
 btc_seven_cities.20c:0 "Separate the crew"
 btc_seven_cities.21_t:0 "Warmongering Natives"
 btc_seven_cities.21_d:0 "Gutural sounds echo around us. We send scouts to find out what is all this commotion about. He reports a local tribe where the muscular bare-chested men fight in a ring until one of them yields or dies. The victor claims the loser's braid. The ruler is the one with the longest braid.\nAll in all, a friendly bunch! Shall we ask them where the Kingdom of Saguenay is?"
 btc_seven_cities.21a:0 "No"
 btc_seven_cities.21b:0 "Give trinkets in exchange for information"
 btc_seven_cities.21c:0 "Fight them in the ring"
 btc_seven_cities.22_t:0 "Endless Plains"
 btc_seven_cities.22_d:0 "For days we seem to be moving nowhere. Everywhere we look all we see is flatland, no mountains in the distance, no forest or woods nearby, just endless plains. I think I've seen that rock 3 hours ago. Are we going around in circles?"
 btc_seven_cities.22a:0 "Keep going west"
 btc_seven_cities.22b:0 "Go against the wind"
 btc_seven_cities.22c:0 "Go with the wind"
 btc_seven_cities.23_t:0 "Wooden Area"
 btc_seven_cities.23_d:0 "We have finally reaches some woods and some shade. However, the further we go the thicker it gets, to the point that we can barely see 10 meters ahead of us. Is that the same branch from 2 hours ago? Yet again our sense of direction is tricking us."
 btc_seven_cities.23a:0 "Separate the men"
 btc_seven_cities.23b:0 "Stay together"
 btc_seven_cities.23c:0 "Get to high ground"
 btc_seven_cities.24_t:0 "Trail of Gold"
 btc_seven_cities.24_d:0 "What is this? Is that a gold amulet? And further ahead, some silver trinkets? The men seem overjoyed with this discovery and go pick up the goods, almost as if following a trail of gold. Will it lead us to Quivira?"
 btc_seven_cities.24a:0 "Follow the trail"
 btc_seven_cities.24b:0 "It's a trap!"

 seven_cities_events.208.d:0 "Wealth comes in many different packages and ways - some claim that the wealth of heart is to be desired, others that piety and prestige should be the only wealth in life. Gold and precious stones is the only wealth our heart desires, and the Golden City of Cibola has made this desire grow fiercely. For every ounce of gold, for every handful of gems we want more and Cibola keeps on giving. One of the Seven Cities of Gold is ours, and we intend to keep it."
 seven_cities_events.211.d:0 "Between the two large mountains of gold and diamonds lie the City of the Caesars, a prosperous city filled with everything you could wish. Food and drink aplenty, eaten and drunk from gold plates rimmed with precious stones. We have found it and claimed it, and we will be rich when all that wealth has been transported home."
 seven_cities_events.214.d:0 "Beneath a large mountain filled with silver a White King resides. Sierra de la Plata - Mountains of Silver - has grown from a legend to a real city and we were the first civilized people to find it! Rejoice, for we have found a place of immense wealth and a people so gullible we will have no problem taking what we want, nay, what we need!"
