 btc_England.1_t:0 "John Cabot Petitions The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 btc_England.1_d:0 "John Cabot, or Zuan Chabotto, has recently sought refuge in [Root.Country.GetName], fleeing debts accrued in his native Venice. Looking for work, he's petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant him funding and a royal patent to assemble a fleet in search of a northern passage to Asia. While some of the court believes he's just looking for an easy payout, many others point to rumours of a recent successful voyage by a fellow Italian, Cristoffa Corombo"
 btc_England.1a:0 "Grant him funding"
 btc_England.1b:0 "Arrest this fraud and seize his assets"
 btc_England.2_t:0 "John Cabot Returns!"
 btc_England.2_d:0 "Suprising many, Cabot's ship returned to harbour, battered and leaking, but still seaworthy. Allegedly, he sailed for more than a month without seeing even a mere island, but on the 47th day, he discovered a winding shore that stretched as far as the eye could see, covered in steep cliffs and windswept grassy plains. Although he was too hesitant to venture more than a crossbow's length from the ship, apparently he sighted the remains of a fire, suggesting the presence of some Asians."
 btc_England.2a:0 "Steep cliffs? Windswept grassy plains? Sounds more like Ireland than India!"
