# Flying Dutchman Events
 btc_expeditions.1_t:0 "Cape of Good Hope Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.1_d:0 "Our sailors approach the treacherous Cape of Good Hope. A blinding mist covers everything the eye can see, and the waves that have continuously been battering our vessel subside. A deafening silence falls upon the ship, as the crew grows restless and their blood freezes, as if ghosts had passed right through them, claiming a part of their souls.\n\nIn the distance there seems to be a silhouette, but none dare utter a single word, paralized with fear. Some pass out, others spoil themselves. And suddenly, as the captain gathers his composure and begins to order his men to head into the unknown, the silhouette disappears. The mist goes away and the sound of waves is heard yet again. Was this all a dream? Could it be..?"
 btc_expeditions.1a:0 "We keep on looking."
 btc_expeditions.2_t:0 "Karimata Strait Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.2_d:0 "Smack in the center of the East Indies, there are few shipping lanes as busy as this one - a perfect spot to conduct privateering endeavours, and consequently to catch the perpetrators of such acts. It is said that a vessel passes through here once a month when the moon is full, dragging down any ship unlucky enough to cross its path into the depths of the ocean.\n\nIn the dark of night, our sailors look for any suspicious activity, but few ships are sighted. And then they hear it - the sound of screams in the distance, echoing through the empty seas!\n\nWe turn our ships towards the source but it is too dark to see anything, the screams of agony being the only guide towards our target. Every second that passes, the intensity of the screams diminishes. One by one they fade into oblivion, never to be heard again. And then.. there was silence.\n\nWhatever remains of the vessels these lost souls travelled in, all we could scavenge were a few wodden planks tainted with blood and chilling marks of scratching."
 btc_expeditions.2a:0 "We keep on looking."
 btc_expeditions.3_t:0 "Bahama Banks Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.3_d:0 "The Caribbean sun greets us, and so do the local pirates who carelessly and loudly approach our flagship, stinking of rum and clearly too drunk from it to understand that 2 cannonballs from our ship is enough to sink their poorly assembled barque. Rather than free them from their miserable lives, we have them take us into the local pirate cove. They had no issues following the scent of degeneracy and leading us right to it.\n\nWe lowered our colours so as not to raise alarms, covering ourselves in rum-drenched rags, putting on eyepatches with skull drawings - and just like that, we fit right in! According to these scallywags, exactly on every equinox of the year, the sea around the area turns calm and a thick mist envelops all. It has become customary for the residents to stay home the entire day, and a few brave souls dare venture to sea... never to be seen again. Legend says that they become part of Davy Jones' crew, for all eternity."
 btc_expeditions.3a:0 "We keep on looking."
 btc_expeditions.4_t:0 "Gulf of Honduras Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.4_d:0 "We've heard reports from our explorers that the natives around this area refer to an apparition they call "Xocoteroj Ajawil", which our translators have roughly understood to mean Ghost Ship. Could this be the Dutchman we seek?\n\nUpon further enquiry, the natives here describe it as always surfacing on the mist. More interesting than this, however, is another legend we had not heard of yet. It would seem that after the Xocoteroj Ajawil leaves, another entity lurks below the surface. None have dared enter the water, so not much else is known other than its given name - "K'iik'enchaj". Our translators seem to think it refers to some sort of serpent or sea creature."
 btc_expeditions.4a:0 "We keep on looking."
 btc_expeditions.5_t:0 "Windward Islands Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.5_d:0 "Ships heading to and from the Caribbean pass through here, making this shipping lane a treasure trove of information for those who seek someone - or something. Yet it seems that at times, no shipping traffic occurs whatsoever.\n\nWe've been told that a large whirlpool forms here at seemingly random times, dragging down any vessel that gets too close. In an almost surreal fashion, the whirpool itself moves with the wind! In our ship, the astronomer looks to the stars for answers, but they do not reply. The navigator asks the wind for guidance, but the wind simply stops blowing.\n\nUntil a cabin boy - too young to even grow a full beard, but skillful enough with sleight-of-hand to consistently deceive our sailors in the daily game of poker - suggests the whirpool to be an illusion! If so, what device could create such power? And who could wield it?"
 btc_expeditions.5a:0 "We keep on looking."
 btc_expeditions.6_t:0 "Coast of Holland Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.6_d:0 "We figure that a vessel named The Flying Dutchman could surely be found in the dutch shores. We hail passing dutch vessels to trade goods with and try to obtain information about our target. At the mere mention of the Dutchman, the usually talkative traders hurry to dismiss us and return to their business. It seems to be a touchy subject around here.\n\nIn order to find out more, a few of our men go ashore. Perhaps talking on firm land will make them more eager to cooperate. Most people we approach laugh it off as a legend meant to scare those who mean to engage in piracy, yet others seem to believe in it wholeheartedly, and some even claim to have seen Davy Jones himself! Probably the ramblings of a drunkard... or is it?\n\nNevertheless, none have spotted the Dutchman in Europe, always directing us towards the East and West Indies."
 btc_expeditions.6a:0 "We keep on looking."
 btc_expeditions.7_t:0 "South Indian Ocean Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.7_d:0 "We have scoured the corners of the world, and no matter how hard we try, the Dutchman seems to always be one step ahead of us. However, our expeditions so far have not been in vain. We have managed to pinpoint all locations in the world in which the legendary vessel has been spotted in, and our skilled cartographers have triangulated a location where it will surely pass by, unaided by natural or mystical phenomena.\n\nBy studying the winds and how ships can take advantage of it, we have decided to engage it by the southern hemisphere's westerly trade wind route."
 btc_expeditions.7a:0 "Let's head there at once!"
 fly_dutch_ending_tt:0 "Send a §JLight Ship§! to investigate the §YSouth Indian Ocean§!."
 btc_expeditions.8_t:0 "The Flying Dutchman"
 btc_expeditions.8_d:0 "As our ships wait for the Dutchman's arrival in the inky darkness of the South Indian Ocean, whispers among the crew spoke of strange sighting and eerie lights on the horizon. Soon, the legends took form as an otherworldly fog enveloped the ship. Creaking sounds echoed through the air, and ghostly apparitions seemed to dance on the edge of visibility.\n\nThrough the dense mist emerged the unmistakable silhouette of the Flying Dutchman, its tattered sails billowing in the phantom wind. The crew watched in awe and trepidation as the cursed vessel approached, captained by the spectral figure known as Davy Jones.\n\nRealizing that escape was futile, our captain rallied his crew, their faces determined and eyes fixed on the approaching phantom ship. The battle-ready frigate maneuvered into position, cannons at the ready, as the ghostly vessel drew near.\n\nThe clash between the living and the undead erupted in a thunderous roar as cannons boomed, and spectral energy crackled through the air. The crew fought with a valor born of desperation.\n\nIn a final burst of cannonball fire, the Flying Dutchman dissolved into the night, leaving behind a trail of mist that slowly dissipated."
