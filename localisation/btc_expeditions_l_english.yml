# Flying Dutchman Events
 btc_expeditions.1_t:0 "Cape of Good Hope Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.1_d:0 "Our sailors approach the treacherous Cape of Good Hope. A blinding mist covers everything the eye can see, and the waves that have continuously been battering our vessel subside. A deafening silence falls upon the ship, as the crew grows restless and their blood freezes, as if ghosts had passed right through them claiming a part of their souls.\n\nIn the distance there seems to be a silhouette, but none dare utter a single word, paralized with fear. Some pass out, others spoil themselves. And suddenly, as the captain gathers his composure and begins to order his men to head into the unknown, the silhouette disappears. The mist goes away and the sound of waves is heard yet again. Was this all a dream? Or is the Dutchman real?"

 btc_expeditions.2_t:0 "Karimata Strait Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.2_d:0 "Smack in the center of the East Indies, there are few shipping lanes as busy as this one - a perfect spot to conduct privateering endeavours, and consequently to catch the perpetrators of such acts. It is said that a vessel passes through here once a month when the moon is full, dragging down any ship unlucky enough to cross its path into the depths of the ocean.\n\nIn the dark of night, our sailors look for any suspicious activity, but few ships are sighted. And then they hear it - the sound of screams in the distance, echoing through the empty seas!\n\nWe turn our ships towards the source but it is too dark to see anything, the screams of agony being the only guide towards our target. Every second that passes, the intensity of the screams diminishes. One by one they fade into oblivion, never to be heard again. And then.. there was silence.\n\nWhatever remains of the vessels these lost souls travelled in, all that remains are a few wodden planks tainted with blood and chilling marks of scratching."

 btc_expeditions.3_t:0 "Bahama Banks Expedition"
 btc_expeditions.3_d:0 "The Caribbean sun greets us, and so do the local pirates who stink of rum, clearly too drunk from it to understand that 2 cannonballs from our ship is enough to sink their poorly assembled barque. Rather than free them from their miserable lives, we have them lead us into the local pirate cove. They had no issues following the scent of degeneracy and leading us right to it.\n\nWe lower our colours so as not to raise alarms, cover ourselves in rum-drenched rags, put on eyepatches and just like that we fit right in! According to these scallywags, "

 btc_expeditions.6_d:0 "We figure that a vessel named The Flying Dutchman could surely be found in the dutch shores. We hail passing dutch vessels to trade goods with and try to obtain information about our target. At the mere mention of the Dutchman, the usually talkative traders hurry to dismiss us and return to their business. It seems to be a touchy subject around here.\n\nIn order to find out more, a few of our men go ashore. Perhaps talking on firm land will make them more eager to talk. Most people we approach laugh it off as a legend meant to scare those who mean to engage in piracy, yet others seem to believe in it wholeheartedly, and some even claim to have seen Davy Jones himself! Probably the ramblings of a drunkard... or is it?\n\nNevertheless, none have spotted the Dutchman in Europe, always directing us towards the East and West Indies."
