These were originally Schieringer, but sought their allies with the 'Vetkoperse' chieftains Gale Galama van Koudum, Jancko Douwema van Langweer and Doitse Albada van Jirnsum.

 dom_frisian.13.d2: "Imperial tradition dictates that the only Kings in the Empire should be the King of the Romans, that being the Emperor himself, and the King of Bohemia. We have however reached an intriguing legal compromise with the Emperor: our monarchs shall use the title of ‘King in Prussia’. As Prussia lies outside the bounds of the Holy Roman Empire, we can name ourselves Kings without any need for the Emperor to break Imperial traditions."
 dom_frisian.13.d3: "The Emperor, that honorless cur, has refused to acknowledge our right to call ourselves Kings no matter what reasonable compromises we proposed. We shall pay him no heed of course, and title ourselves as Kings regardless."
