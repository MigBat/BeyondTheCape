# BEYOND THE CAPE: v1.0.0 #
###########################

### PROVINCES ###

# added Setúbal and Beira Baixa provinces.
# renamed Beira to Beira Alta.
# replaced Aveiro province with Minho.
# Denmark Strait province incorporated into Denmark Sea province. (denmark strait is a coastal sea tile, meaning the New World could be explored without QFNTW.
# Porto now produces cloth rather than wine (an event can change it to wine).
# Bragança now produces livestock rather than wine (an event can change it to wine).

### TRADE ###

# created new trade node Lisboa, splitting the Sevilla node in two. It receives trade from Gulf of St. Lawrence, Caribbean, Ivory Coast and Safi. It transfers to Sevilla and English Channel. The Lisboa node is comparable in size to the Valencia node.
# added North Morocco area to Safi trade node.
# now trade flows from Hormuz to Gulf of Aden rather than the other way around.

### COLONIAL REGIONS AND TRADE COMPANIES ###

# added Portuguese Charter in Lisboa trade node.
# added North Morocco area to Maghreb Charter.
# the caribbeans is no longer a colonial region, it is now a trade company region. this is to represent the variety of nations that colonized the islands and to promote competition between the countries, in particular privateering.

### MONUMENTS ###

# added Mosteiro da Batalha monument in Coimbra. It took over a century to build, starting in 1386 and ending circa 1517, spanning the reign of seven kings. We feel this more adequately represents what a monument is in the game.
# removed Torre de Belem monument in Lisboa. It's just a glorified naval battery. It still exists in the game in the form of a modifier given by a mission.
# fuerte del morro monument (Puerto Rico) bonuses have been adjusted, since it is no longer located in a colonial region.

### DISASTERS ###

# reworked castilian civil war disaster, giving Portugal and Aragon a chance to claim the crown of Castile.

### EVENTS ###

# added many new portuguese events, including a much improved Lisbon Earthquake event chain, and reworked existing ones.
# reworked Columbus event (more under "exploration").
# removed the Iberian Wedding event since it has been integrated into the castilian civil war disaster event chain.
# added Irmandinos Revolt event chain that focuses on Castile, Galicia and Portugal.

### MISSIONS ###

# added new Portuguese missions and reworked existing ones. Number of missions is now on par with that of England.
# all countries that have missions to colonize the caribbeans have had their missions adequately modified to represent the change from colonial region to trade company.

### IDEAS ###

# reworked exploration ideas to be more historically accurate. Now QFTNW gives ships +1 speed and does not allow hiring explorers and conquistadors (more under "exploration").
# changed Granada traditions to include enemy coring cost.
# changed Portuguese traditions to include morale damage done by units.

### EXPLORATION ###

# diplomatic tech 7 now triggers an event for countries with exploration ideas which gives the ability to hire explorers, conquistadors and to sail into ocean provinces.

Developer note: We have decided to change how exploration happens in the game because we feel it deviates too much from what actually happened. Historically, since the start of the game Portugal is the only nation that is completely 
focusing on exploration, while Castile still has to finish the reconquista and deal with internal turmoil and the affairs with Aragon. Additionally, Portugal's whole plan was to sail around Africa to get to India, not really focusing 
on sailing west, like Columbus did. This is made clear by the fact that Columbus was rejected TWICE by the King of Portugal before he took his ideas to Castile. Thus, we wanted to represent this in the game somehow. 
Portugal will receive the chance to hire Columbus if the year is at least 1480. If they reject the offer (if they discovered Cape province this is the only option), Castile will have that chance. However, they
first need to conquer Granada, to represent the end of the reconquista and the beginning of looking outwards to the sea. If Columbus is hired, not only will the country get an explorer with great pips, but also the country will receive
a modifier that will allow hiring explorers, conquistadors and exploring ocean tiles, without needing to wait for diplomatic tech 7!
So now, even though Portugal starts with an explorer, they will be unable to hire new ones until they reach diplomatic tech 7, or accept Columbus' proposal. Through the completion of their mission tree, we have given Portugal numerous
famous explorers, so they can continue their journey around Africa into India.

### FLAGSHIPS ###

# replaced spanish 100% more cannnons with 100% more durability (spanish galleons were sturdier than most to endure their long journeys, and to resist piracy attempts)
# added spanish +6 engagement width.
# replaced portuguese 125% exploration range with 100% more cannons (see the Galleon S. João Baptista, aka Botafogo)

### OTHER CHANGES ###

# added many new songs when you play as Portugal, including the main theme.
# reworked Portugal's borders, terrain and rivers.
# slightly changed Gulf of Valencia so Aragon can no longer claim Granada's provinces.
# added new trade winds in South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans.
# Henrique o Navegador advisor is no longer a naval reformer. He is now a navigator, as the name suggests.
